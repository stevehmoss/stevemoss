<h3>Goodbye 2018</h3>
<h4>February 8, 2019</h4>
2018 was not a good year for me. Something went wrong with my medication and I experienced the physical symptoms of depression for most of the year. (By "physical symptoms" I mean I was feeling tired, un-motivated and devoid of energy, but I wasn't having pessimistic thoughts or believing the world was a bad place). I seem to be on the mend now, but as you can see from the <a href="news/2018.html">2018</a>page, I got very little done around the place.

You hear wise people say that when you feel like you haven't achieved anything, try looking back at how things were before you started. Thanks to the magical power of the camera, it's possible to do just that, and here is a little of what I saw:
