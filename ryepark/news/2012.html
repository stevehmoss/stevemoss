<h3>Last News of the Year</h3>
<h4>December 31 2012</h4>
The widening of the back verandah is now visibly real:

and here you can see the temporary bathroom 2.0, and on the left is the space where the final bathroom will be - yes, it will have a fireplace!

<h3>Fireplace Progresses Adequately</h3>
<h4>October 28 2012</h4>
We bought the fire-surround for $51 on ebay a few months ago, and I put it onto the wall while adding some lining and insulation. The top-left is how we first saw the room back in 07:

Note: In the bottom-left photo you can see translucent circles called "orbs". They aren't on the camera lens as another photo shows:

These are only found in digital photographs. Apparently you can pick your own explanation - one is that they are an intelligent life-form from a parallel universe, but nut-jobs think it is an artefact of the interaction of light and dust in low light using a cheap camera...

<h3>Redesign of Website</h3>
<h4>October 1 2012</h4>
The news is now right here on the Home Page. I find on other websites that this is helpful because I go there to check the news but the rest of the site is right there as well.

<br>
The colour scheme is supposed to vaguely match the colours of the house.
<br>
<br>
And here are an alien cat and dog...

<h3>Temporary Shed/Pantry</h3>
<h4>September 28 2012</h4>
Okay, it looks a bit weird. We needed some usable space where the extension is going - a bit of work-space and the fridge and freezer. But I need to be able to build the new floor underneath, so it's raised:

The (temporary) bathroom is still 1.0 - I'll be able to work around it for a bit longer.

<h3>Temporary Kitchen 2.0</h3>
<h4>September 26 2012</h4>
In order to get started on the extension at the back of the house we needed to move the kitchen temporarily into the dining room:

<h3>One Less Room</h3>
<h4>February 15 2012</h4>
We've finally got rid of the wall between the lounge and dining room and we're enjoying the extra space!
