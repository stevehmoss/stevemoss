<br>Kate decided to come to Oz for just a month after it was taking too long to get a visa for Erick. Hopefully they'll all be coming for a longer stay later in the year.

Was that a stove with a flue attached you saw in the background? It's finally been installed!

<h3>Welcome All Aliens!</h3>
<h4>May 2, 2016</h4>
I've been working on a good location map for the cabin to put on the <a href="wallaga/getting-there.html">"Getting There"</a> page for the Wallaga cabin. I wasn't sure how far afield to give directions from...

<br>
<br>
A long time since posting any news here but things have been hapenning all the same. We've had power and plumbing connected to the cabin on our block at home, and the front spare room is lined and painted:

<br>
<br>
But the biggest news is what a fantastic weekend was had at Wallaga Lake by a pack of Mosses rarely seen in the wild:

They've even got <a href="https://steveslawn.ga/wallaga/anzac2016.html">their own page</a> on this site!

<h3>New Hall Wall</h3>
<h4>January 5, 2015</h4>
Happy New Year to all! We had a quiet Christmas and New Year, And I had a very pleasant birthday yesterday with visit from Mum and Dad, and a little bit of rain (and more today).
<br>
<br>
Work on the house moved a little faster in December with the help of Gene Pearsall, a local handyman, who will definitely be back for more work in January. We built this wall between the kitchen and hall, and now the lining is all up in the kitchen and front bedroom so all that's needed is the plastering:
