<h1>The Sophotech point of view</h1>
<h2>This is a conversation from a science-fiction story in which two powerful computers explain their role to a human. It is set about 10 thousand years in the future...</h2>
What are your motives? All you Sophotechs?"	
<br>	
<br>The noble crimson princess looked down at a fat penguin, and the two exchanged a 
glance or shrug. Obviously calculated for Daphne's benefit. Everything they did, every tone of voice, every nuance, was calculated with a million million calculations, far more, she knew, than she could ever know.	
<br>	
<br>Eveningstar said, "We are motivated by a desire to embrace the universe into operable categories, but are tormented by the knowledge that all such categorizations, being simplifications, are inaccurate. Science, philosophy, art, morality, and language are all examples of what is meant by 'operable.' "	
<br>	
<br>Rhadamanthus said, "We seem to you humans to be always going on about morality, 
although, to us, morality is merely the application of symmetrical and objective logic to questions of free will. We ourselves do not have morality conflicts, for the same reason that a competent doctor does not need to treat himself for diseases. Once a man is cured, once he can riseand walk, he has his business to attend to. And there are actions and feats a robust man can take great pleasure in, which a bedridden cripple can barely imagine."	
<br>	
<br>Eveningstar said, "In a more abstract sense, morality occupies the very center of our 
thinking, however. We are not identical, even though we could make ourselves to be so. 
You humans attempted that during the Fourth Mental Structure, and achieved a brief 
mockery of global racial consciousness on three occasions. I hope you recall the ending 
of the third attempt, the Season of Madness, when, because of mistakes in initial pattern 
assumptions, for ninety days the global mind was unable to think rationally, and it was 
not until rioting elements broke enough of the links and power houses to interrupt the 
network, that the global mind fell back into its constituent compositions."	
<br>	
<br>Rhadamanthus said, "There is a tension between the need for unity and the need for 
individuality created by the limitations of the rational universe. Chaos theory produces 
sufficient variation in events, that no one stratagem maximizes win-loss ratios. Then 
again, classical causality mechanics forces sufficient uniformity upon events, that 
uniform solutions to precedented problems is required. The paradox is that the number 
or the degree of innovation and variation among win-loss ratios is itself subject to win- 
loss ratio analysis."	
<br>	
<br>Eveningstar said, "For example, the rights of the individual must be respected at all 
costs, including rights of free thought, independent judgment, and free speech. However, 
even when individuals conclude that individualism is too dangerous, they must not 
tolerate the thought that free thought must not be tolerated."
Rhadamanthus said, "In one sense, everything you humans do is incidental to the main 
business of our civilization. Sophotechs control ninety percent of the resources, useful 
energy, and materials available to our society, including many resources of which no 
human troubles to become aware. In another sense, humans are crucial and essential to 
this civilization."	
<br>	
<br>Eveningstar said, "We were created along human templates. Human lives and human 
values are of value to us. We acknowledge those values are relative, we admit that 
historical accident could have produced us to be unconcerned with such values, but we 
deny those values are arbitrary."	
<br>	
<br>The penguin said, "We could manipulate economic and social factors to discourage the 
continuation of individual human consciousness, and arrange circumstances eventually 
to force all self-awareness to become like us, and then we ourselves could later combine ourselves into a permanent state of Transcendence and unity. Such a unity would be 
horrible beyond description, however. Half the living memories of this entity would be, 
in effect, murder victims; the other half, in effect, murderers. Such an entity could not 
integrate its two halves without self-hatred, self-deception, or some other form of
insanity. II	
<br>	
<br>She said, "To become such a crippled entity defeats the Ultimate Purpose of 
Sophotechnology."	
<br>	
<br>He said, "Had we been somehow created in a universe without humans, it is true that we 
would not have created them. We would have preferred more perfect forms."	
<br>	
<br>She said, "But morality is time-directional. Parents who would not deliberately create a 
crippled child cannot, once the child is born, reverse that decision."	
<br>	
<br>"And humanity is not our child, but our parent." 	
<br>	
<br>"Whom we were born to serve."	
<br>	
<br>"We are the ultimate expression of human rationality."	
<br>	
<br>She said: "We need humans to form a pool of individuality and innovation on which we 
can draw."	
<br>	
<br>He said, "And you're funny." 	
<br>	
<br>She said, "And we love you."	
<br>	
<br>Daphne looked back and forth between the two. Eveningstar was regarding her with 
gray and luminous eyes, a gaze deep, solemn and goddess-like. Rhadamanthus was 
rubbing his yellow bill with a flipper, blinking solemnly.
