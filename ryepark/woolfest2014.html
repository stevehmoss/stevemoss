(I'll add a few videos here onced I've re-jiggered them for loading onto the interwebs)

Then we had a look at some of the 36 entries in the Beanie, Beret & Tea Cosy Competition, in which Lesley and Vicki both had a couple of pieces. The competition was won by June from Rye Park with the Beer-can hat:

Then we watched the actual running of the sheep. This photo shows the town in a state of anticipatory hush immediately proir:
