						<h1>An Experimental Paul</h1>
			What follows is purely an experiment to see what Paul would look like if the letters were taken out of the context of the Jewish religion. I am not an academic and I'm just playing around with an idea. I am well aware of how silly this idea will seem to many, but I present it here as is, with only a few brief notes to explain my thinking:
				<br>
				<br>
				Nothing at all is known about First Century Christianity from sources outside the Christian texts themselves. Most Biblical scholars agree that the earliest Christian writings are the letters that Paul wrote to the communities he established in several cities located in the Eastern half of the Roman Empire during the middle decades of the First Century of the Common Era. The oldest fragments of these letters that exist today date to the<a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_manuscript#Earliest_extant_manuscripts">late second century,</a> over a hundred years after they are thought to have been actually written by Paul. They are undoubtedly copies of copies of copies, and must contain many alterations both by mistake and by deliberate modification.
				<br>
				<br>
				During that intervening century the four canonical Gospels were written. The story of Jesus as a living man was written for the first time in Mark, probably late First Century, and the story was placed within the context of the Jewish religion and the geographical setting of Jerusalem and surrounding countryside. I think that the letters of Paul were modified during this time to fit within the broader Jewish cultural framework, even though Paul's letters seem to be really saying that the spirituality he has discovered is purely between oneself and God. It is the Christ within us that has a relationship with God like that which the "son" has with the "father" - no religion required. The God found in Paul is not a creator or an enforcer, but a benign universal Power concerned only with the propagation of Love.
				<br>
				<br>
				Paul's letters are to the Greek-speaking people of the Roman world. The places he wrote to are a long way from Judea, the closest being Galatia in what is now Turkey, the rest all being in Greece or Italy. Why is he bothering to discuss Jewish Law with them? He is constantly referring to his ministry being directed to the Gentiles, who surely would neither know about or be intersted in the Jewish religion. I can't prove that the Jewish stuff was added later, so I won't even attempt to do so. What I'm really interested in is trying to get a sense of how things were in those first few decades. There was an exciting new kind of spirituality beginning, one in which everyone was equal both within the organisational structure of the communities and in the eyes of God. It was a spiritual community with the only governing authority being the power of Love. I think it was inevitable that something so sweet and simple would be overrun by an influx of people getting on the band-wagon and securing positions of power. In a funny way we owe it to these people that we still have access to Paul's original writings: It was by fitting Christianity into the time-line of the older, established Jewish religion that Christianity was made solid, powerful and robust enough to last for thousands of years. Paul's gentle ideas of love and humility would have fallen into dust long ago if they hadn't been taken over by people wanting to serve themselves...
				<br>
				<br>
				So what I have done here is I've removed all of the discussion about Jewish Law. Most of this is in the letter to the Romans. That letter is by far the longest, but without the Jewish stuff its length becomes similar to the others, which seems more likely to me. I have also removed phrases which sound like they are saying Jesus was human, because I don't think Paul ever thought that.
				<br>
				<br>
				I've used the "Scholars Version" of Paul, found in <a href="https://www.westarinstitute.org/projects/the-jesus-seminar/jesus-seminar-on-paul/">Authentic Letters of Paul.</a>This is a new translation, with a re-ordering of the structure and chronology and the removal of several letters not thought to be by the same author. I apologise to the authors of the SV for the ruthless way in which I have decimated their work. I have only subtracted, I haven't added anything. I have made a few minor changes to their language just to help the flow. I've abandoned the traditional numbering of chapters and verses, as these did not occur in any early manuscripts.
				<br>
				<br>It is my own personal opinion that what follows might be closer to what Paul actually wrote, however I stress again that it is just an experiment to see what Paul might look like if the letters were taken out of the context of the Jewish Religion.

<h1>Paul's Letter to the Thessalonians </h1>
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to those in Thessalonica who are called together by God (the universal force of Love) and Christ, God's Annointed (the one who gives us access to God's new world) divine favour and peace to you. We always thank God for all of you, and have you in mind when we pray. Before God, our Benefactor, we constantly recall your work of confident trust, your active love and your unwavering hope in Christ.
<br>
<br>
Dear friends, it is clear to us that you are loved by God and are a special people. Our world-transforming message did not come to you as mere rhetoric, but with the power and presence of God, and with unqualified conviction. You recognized accurately what kind of messengers we were when we were among you for your benefit. And so, you became imitators of us when you accepted our message, though under great stress, with the joy of God's presence and power. Therefore, you have become, in turn, a model for all those in Macedonia and Greece who have put their confidence and trust in God. Indeed, you have made our message about the Christ resound not only throughout Macedonia and Greece, but everywhere your trust in God is so widely known that we don't need to mention it.
<br>
<br>
These reports about you demonstrate how effective our stay was among you: how you have turned away from lifeless images in order to serve the living and real God and to find God's "son", Christ, within yourselves. It is this Christ who will rescue us from the condemnation that is sure to come. For you know from your own experience, friends, that our stay among you was not without power, but despite having just been assaulted and insulted in Philippi, as you know, God gave us the courage to speak God's world-transforming message to you in the face of great opposition. For we are not motivated by error or by insincerity or by deceit, but we have been authorized by God to spread this message. We speak, not in order to please people, but to please God who already knows our intentions. For, as you also know, we never used flowery rhetoric nor pretense for personal gain - so help me God - nor did we look for popular acclaim, either from you or from others - although as envoys of God's Anointed we could have thrown our weight around! But we treated you gently like a nanny caring for her children. We were so devoted to you that we were willing to share with you not only God's message but our own lives as well—that is how much your friendship meant to us. For I'm sure you remember the stress and strain we endured as we worked night and day so as not to impose on anyone while we were sharing God's message with you. You are eyewitnesses - and so is God - to how we treated you who were persuaded by God's message with respect, fairness, and integrity. So you can't deny that we cared for each one of you as if you were our own children, prodding, encouraging, and coaxing you to live in a manner pleasing to God, who summons you into his own kingdom and splendour. For this reason we have stressed how thankful we are to God that when you heard what we had to say about God, you accepted it not as a human argument, but really as the wisdom of God which enlightens and energizes you who embrace it. So, you became imitators, friends, of those communities in Judea for whom Christ is God's Anointed: you have been harassed by your fellow citizens in the same way that they have been by theirs. 
<br>
<br>
Since we have been separated from you for a short time, in person but not in our hearts, we eagerly yearn to see you again face to face. Indeed, we tried to return to you - I, Paul, tried more than once - but our plans were frustrated. Who will be our pride and joy and crowning glory when we meet manifest the Christ, if not you? Yes, you are truly our pride and joy! Therefore, since I couldn't leave Athens, we decided to send Timothy, a dear friend and fellow advocate of our message about the Anointed, both to bolster you and to allay the threats to your confidence in God so that none of you would be shaken by these attacks. For you surely realized that we were in danger! Remember that we warned you when we were last with you that we might be persecuted, and that's what happened, as you know. When I could not stand to worry for fear that you had been so shaken by these threats that our work had come to nothing. But now Timothy has returned to us with a glowing report of your confidence in God and your love for us, emphasizing your affectionate feelings toward us and that you miss us as much as we miss you. Therefore, the news about your faithfulness has cheered us up despite all our trials and tribulations because we can cope if you remain committed to the Christ's service. For what offering can we give to God in return for all the joy you have given us? And so we pray night and day that God will allow us to see you again in person and to supply what is lacking in your understanding of what it means to trust in God. May God our Creator and Benefactor direct our path straight to you. And may the lord inspire in you the same kind of unfailing and abundant friendship for one another and for others as we have for you, so that your intentions may remain firm in complete integrity before our Creator and Benefactor. 
<br>
<br>
Finally, friends, we ask you - we implore you - to remember how crucial it is for you who belong to Christ to live and to serve God as we taught you. You have started living in the right way; but you should do so even more consistently. For you know that what we taught you was authorized by Christ. 
<br>
<br>
So, concerning the virtuous life: God wants you to keep your distance from sexual immorality. "Each one of you should know how to treat his own wife with respect and honor 'and not as a sexual object as do the nations who do not know God. "Nor should you offend or deceive your brother in sexual mat-ters, because the lord is one who will see that justice is done in all such matters, as we clearly warned you before. "For our God has not called us to loose living but to a life of virtue. 'Therefore, anyone who rejects this is not rejecting human ad-vice but the God who breathes the spirit of goodness into you. 'Concerning your relationships with one another: I don't need to add anything to the God-given precept that you should love one another. "You are already practicing this pre-cept in your dealings with your fellow believers in Macedonia, but we urge you, friends, to do this extravagantly. 11As we've urged you before: live a quiet life, mind your own business, and support yourselves, "so that outsiders might respect you and you might be self-sufficient. 33Concerning those who have died, we don't want you to be uninformed: you shouldn't mourn as do those without hope. "Because if we believe "Jesus died and arose," so also God will bring with Jesus all those belonging to him who have died. "We can assure you of this by these prophetic words from the lord: we who are still alive when Jesus comes will not be given preference over those who have already died. "the lord himself will descend from heaven with a loud summons, with an archangel's shout and with the trumpet of God, then those who have already died and belong to the Anointed will ascend first; "then those of us who are still living will be caught up with them in the clouds to greet the lord in the air. And so we will be with the lord from then on. 
"So you should encourage each other with these prophetic 5 Concerning the chronology of the great events to come: friends, you don't need to have [anything] written to you. 'Surely you know perfectly well that the day of the lord ar-rives like a thief in the night. 'When everyone expects peace and security, that's just when ruin strikes without warning, or [it is] like the sudden onset of birth contractions in a pregnant woman—no one can avoid such events. 'But you, friends, are not in the dark so that the day [of the lord] would catch you by surprise like a thief. 'Rather, you are enlightened people, a people of the day. We are not denizens of the night living in the dark. 'Therefore, let us not sleep through life as others do, but be fully awake and in control of ourselves. 7"Night-people" are always asleep and drunkards are never sober, 'but since we are "day-people" let us always be in control of our senses and let us protect ourselves with the armor of our confidence in God and our unselfish love for one another and with a helmet of the hope of our liberation. "For God has not set us up for condemnation, but intends for us to be liberated through our lord Jesus, God's Anointed, "who died for us so that— whether we have died or are still alive—we might live together with him. "Therefore, continue to encourage one an-other and to support each other as you have been doing. "Next, we urge you, friends, to recognize those among you who are fellow missionaries and those who care for you as members of the lord's people and those who mentor you. "You should highly respect them and love them for what they are doing. In short, cooperate freely with each other! "We also plead with you, friends: caution the unruly, encourage those who lack confidence, help the weak, be patient with everyone. "Make sure that you don't retaliate against evil, but always seek the good for each other, even for outsiders. "Always be joyous; "live with reverence; "be thankful in every circumstance, for this is how God intends for you to live as members of the people for whom Jesus is God's Anointed. "Don't suppress charismatic fervor. "Don't be condescending about prophesying, "but test everything. Hold onto what is good "and keep your distance from every form of evil. "And now may the true God, the God of peace, fill you with goodness; and may you be fully prepared in body, mind, and spirit for the arrival of our lord, Jesus God's Anointed. "The One who calls you is completely trustworthy. "Friends, please pray for us. "Embrace each other. 27On the basis of my authority from the lord, I solemnly charge you to read this letter to all of our friends. "The favor of Jesus, God's Anointed, be with you.
