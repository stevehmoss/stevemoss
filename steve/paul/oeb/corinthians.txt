Paul’s First Letter to the
--------------------------

Corinthians
===========

 [1 Corinthians 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] To the church of God in Corinth, to those who have been consecrated by union with Christ Jesus and called to become his people, and also to all, wherever they may be, who invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ – their Master and ours,[1:2] from Paul, who has been called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and from Sosthenes, our fellow follower of the Lord.

[1:3] May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.

[1:4] I always thank God about you for the blessing bestowed on you in Christ Jesus.[1:5] For through union with him you were enriched in every way – in your power to preach, and in your knowledge of the truth;[1:6] and so became yourselves a confirmation of my testimony to the Christ.[1:7] There is no gift in which you are deficient, while waiting for the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.[1:8] And God himself will strengthen you to the end, so that at the day of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be found blameless.[1:9] God will not fail you, and it is he who called you into communion with his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.

##### The State of the Church at Corinth #####

[1:10] But I appeal to you, my friends, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree in what you profess, and not to allow divisions to exist among you, but to be united – of one mind and of one opinion.[1:11] For I have been informed, my friends, by the members of Chloe’s household, that party feeling exists among you.[1:12] I mean this: that every one of you says either “I follow Paul,” or “I Apollos,” or “I Cephas,” or “I Christ.”[1:13] You have torn the Christ in pieces! Was it Paul who was crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?[1:14] I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,[1:15] so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name.[1:16] I baptized also the household of Stephanas. I do not know that I baptized anyone else.[1:17] My mission from Christ was not to baptize, but to tell the good news; not, however, in the language of philosophy, in case the cross of the Christ should be robbed of its meaning.

[1:18] The message of the cross is indeed mere folly to those who are in the path to ruin, but to us who are in the path of salvation it is the power of God.[1:19] For scripture says –

|  “I will bring the philosophy of the philosophers to naught, and the shrewdness of the shrewd I will bring to nothing.”

[1:20] Where is the philosopher? Where the teacher of the Law? Where the disputant of today? Has not God shown the world’s philosophy to be folly?[1:21] For since the world, in God’s wisdom, did not by its philosophy learn to know God, God saw fit, by the “folly” of our proclamation, to save those who believe in Christ![1:22] While Jews ask for miraculous signs, and Greeks study philosophy,[1:23] we are proclaiming Christ crucified! – to the Jews an obstacle, to the Gentiles mere folly,[1:24] but to those who have received the call, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God![1:25] For God’s “folly” is wiser than people, and God’s “weakness” is stronger than people.

[1:26] Look at the facts of your call, friends. There are not many among you who are wise, as people reckon wisdom, not many who are influential, not many who are high-born;[1:27] but God chose what the world counts foolish to put its wise to shame, and God chose what the world counts weak to put its strong to shame,[1:28] and God chose what the world counts poor and insignificant – things that to it are unreal – to bring its “realities” to nothing,[1:29] so that in his presence no one should boast.[1:30] But you, by your union with Christ Jesus, belong to God; and Christ, by God’s will, became not only our wisdom, but also our righteousness, holiness, and deliverance,[1:31] so that – in the words of scripture –

|  “Whoever boasts should boast of the Lord!”

 [1 Corinthians 2] 

[2:1] For my own part, friends, when I came to you, it was with no display of eloquence or philosophy that I came to tell the hidden purpose of God;[2:2] for I had determined that, while with you, I would forget everything Jesus Christ – and him crucified![2:3] Indeed, when I came among you, I was weak, and full of fears, and in great anxiety.[2:4] My message and my proclamation were not delivered in the persuasive language of philosophy, but were accompanied by the manifestation of spiritual power,[2:5] so that your faith should be based, not on the human wisdom, but on the power of God.

[2:6] Yet there is a philosophy that we teach to those whose faith is matured, but it is not the philosophy of today, or of the leaders of today – whose downfall is at hand.[2:7] No, it is a divine philosophy that we teach, one concerned with the hidden purpose of God – that long hidden philosophy which God, before time began, destined for our glory.[2:8] This philosophy is not known to any of the leaders of today; for, had they known it, they would not have crucified our glorified Lord.[2:9] It is what scripture speaks of as –

|  “What eye never saw, nor ear ever heard,
|  what never entered people’s minds –
|    even all that God has prepared for those who love him.”

[2:10] Yet to us God revealed it through his Spirit; for the Spirit fathoms all things, even the inmost depths of God’s being.[2:11] For what person is there who knows what a person is, except the person’s own spirit within them? So, also, no one comprehends what God is, except the Spirit of God.[2:12] And as for us, it is not the spirit of the world that we have received, but the Spirit that comes from God, so that we may realize the blessings given to us by him.[2:13] And we speak of these gifts, not in language taught by human philosophy, but in language taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things in spiritual words.[2:14] The merely intellectual person rejects the teaching of the Spirit of God; for to them it is mere folly; they cannot grasp it, because it is to be understood only by spiritual insight.[2:15] But the person with spiritual insight is able to understand everything, although they themselves are understood by no one.[2:16] For who has so comprehended the mind of the Lord as to be able to instruct him? We, however, have the mind of Christ.

 [1 Corinthians 3] 

[3:1] But I, my friends, could not speak to you as people with spiritual insight, but only as worldly-minded – mere infants in the faith of Christ.[3:2] I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you were not then able to take it.

No, and even now you are not able; you are still worldly.[3:3] While there exist among you jealousy and party feeling, is it not true that you are worldly, and are acting merely as other people do?[3:4] When one says “I follow Paul,” and another “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you like other people?[3:5] What, I ask, is Apollos? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom you were led to accept the faith; and that only as the Lord helped each of you.[3:6] I planted, and Apollos watered, but it was God who caused the growth.[3:7] Therefore neither the one who plants, nor the one who waters, counts for anything, but only God who causes the growth.[3:8] In this the person who plants and the person who waters are one; yet each will receive their own reward in proportion to their own labour.[3:9] For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s harvest field, God’s building.

[3:10] In fulfilment of the charge which God had entrusted to me, I laid the foundation like a skilful master; but someone else is now building on it. Let everyone take care how they build;[3:11] for no one can lay any other foundation than the one already laid – Jesus Christ.[3:12] Whatever is used by those who build on this foundation, whether gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,[3:13] the quality of each man’s work will become known, for the day will make it plain; because that day is to be ushered in with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of every man’s work.[3:14] If anyone’s work, which they have built on that foundation, still remains, they will gain a reward.[3:15] If anyone’s work is burnt up, they will suffer loss; though they themselves will escape, but only as one who has passed through fire.

[3:16] Don’t you know that you are God’s Temple, and that God’s Spirit has his home in you?[3:17] If any one destroys the Temple of God, God will destroy them; for the Temple of God is sacred, and so also are you.

[3:18] Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you imagines that, as regards this world, they are wise, they should become a “fool,” that they may become wise.[3:19] For in God’s sight this world’s wisdom is folly. Scripture tells of –

|  “One who catches the wise in their own craftiness,”

[3:20] And it says again –

|  “The Lord sees how fruitless are the deliberations of the wise.”

[3:21] Therefore let no one boast about people; for all things are yours –[3:22] Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or the present, or the future – all things are yours![3:23] But you are Christ’s and Christ is God’s.

 [1 Corinthians 4] 

[4:1] Let people look on us as Christ’s servants, and as stewards of the hidden truths of God.[4:2] Now what we look for in stewards is that they should be trustworthy.[4:3] But it weighs very little with me that I am judged by you or by any human tribunal. No, I do not even judge myself;[4:4] for, though I am conscious of nothing against myself, that does not prove me innocent. It is the Lord who is my judge.[4:5] Therefore do not pass judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes. He will throw light on what is now dark and obscure, and will reveal the motives in people’s minds; and then everyone will receive due praise from God.

[4:6] All this, friends, I have, for your sakes, applied to Apollos and myself, so that, from our example, you may learn to observe the precept – “Keep to what is written,” that none of you may speak boastfully of one teacher to the disparagement of another.[4:7] For who makes any one of you superior to others? And what have you that was not given you? But if you received it as a gift, why do you boast as if you had not?[4:8] Are you all so soon satisfied? Are you so soon rich? Have you begun to reign without us? Would indeed that you had, so that we also might reign with you![4:9] For, as it seems to me, God has exhibited us, the apostles, last of all, as people doomed to death. We are made a spectacle to the universe, both to angels and to people![4:10] We, for Christ’s sake, are fools, but you, by your union with Christ, are people of discernment. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honoured, but we are despised.[4:11] To this very hour we go hungry, thirsty, and naked; we are beaten; we are homeless;[4:12] we work hard, toiling with our own hands. We meet abuse with blessings, we meet persecution with endurance,[4:13] we meet slander with gentle appeals. We have been treated as the scum of the earth, the vilest of the vile, to this very hour.

[4:14] It is with no wish to shame you that I am writing like this; but to warn you as my own dear children.[4:15] Though you may have thousands of instructors in the faith of Christ, yet you have not many fathers. It was I who, through union with Christ Jesus, became your father by means of the good news.[4:16] Therefore I entreat you – Follow my example.[4:17] This is my reason for sending Timothy to you. He is my own dear faithful child in the Master’s service, and he will remind you of my methods of teaching the faith of Christ Jesus – methods which I follow everywhere in every church.

[4:18] Some, I hear, are puffed up with pride, thinking that I am not coming to you.[4:19] But come to you I will, and that soon, if it please the Lord; and then I will find out, not what words these people use who are so puffed up, but what power they possess;[4:20] for the kingdom of God is based, not on words, but on power.[4:21] What do you wish? Am I to come to you with a rod, or in a loving and gentle spirit?

 [1 Corinthians 5] 

[5:1] There is a wide-spread report respecting a case of immorality among you, and that, too, of a kind that does not occur even among the Gentiles – a man, I hear, is living with his father’s wife![5:2] Instead of grieving over it and taking steps for the expulsion of the man who has done this thing, is it possible that you are still puffed up?[5:3] For I myself, though absent in body, have been present with you in spirit, and in the name of our Lord Jesus I have already passed judgment, just as if I had been present, on the man who has acted in this way.[5:4] I have decided – having been present in spirit at your meetings, when the power of the Lord Jesus was with us –[5:5] to deliver such a man as this over to Satan, that what is sensual in him may be destroyed, so that his spirit may be saved at the day of the Lord.[5:6] Your boasting is unseemly. Don’t you know that even a little leaven leavens all the dough?[5:7] Get rid entirely of the old leaven, so that you may be like new dough – free from leaven, as in truth you are. For our passover lamb is already sacrificed – Christ himself;[5:8] therefore let us keep our festival, not with the leaven of former days, nor with the leaven of vice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

[5:9] I told you, in my letter, not to associate with immoral people –[5:10] not, of course, meaning people of the world who are in immoral, or who are covetous and grasping, or who worship idols; for then you would have to leave the world altogether.[5:11] But, as things are, I say that you are not to associate with anyone who, although a follower of Christ in name, is immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or grasping – no, not even to sit down to eat with such people.[5:12] What have I to do with judging those outside the church? Is it not for you to judge those who are within the church,[5:13] while God judges those who are outside? Put away the wicked from among you.

 [1 Corinthians 6] 


[6:1] Can it be that, when one of you has a dispute with another, they dare to have their case tried before the heathen, instead of before Christ’s people?[6:2] Don’t you know that Christ’s people will try the world? And if the world is to be tried by you, are you unfit to try the most trivial cases?[6:3] Don’t you know that we are to try angels – to say nothing of the affairs of this life?[6:4] Why, then, if you have cases relating to the affairs of this life, do you set to try them those who carry no weight with the church? To your shame I ask it.[6:5] Can it be that there is not one among you wise enough to decide between two of their fellow followers?[6:6] Must a follower sue a fellow follower? In front of unbelievers?[6:7] To begin with, it is undoubtedly a loss to you to have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why not rather let yourselves be cheated?[6:8] Instead of this, you wrong and cheat others yourselves – yes, even other followers![6:9] Don’t you know that wrong-doers will have no share in God’s kingdom? Do not be deceived. No one who is immoral, or an idolater, or an adulterer, or licentious, or a sexual pervert,[6:10] or a thief, or covetous, or a drunkard, or abusive, or grasping, will have any share in God’s kingdom.[6:11] Such some of you used to be; but you washed yourselves clean. You became Christ’s people! You were pronounced righteous through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the Spirit of our God!

[6:12] Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but for my part, I will not let myself be enslaved by anything.[6:13] Food exists for the stomach, and the stomach for food; but God will put an end to both the one and the other. The body, however, exists, not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;[6:14] and, as God has raised the Lord, so he will raise up us also by the exercise of his power.[6:15] Don’t you know that your bodies are Christ’s members? Am I, then, to take the members that belong to the Christ and make them the members of a prostitute? Heaven forbid![6:16] Or don’t you know that a man who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body (for “the two,” it is said, “will become one”);[6:17] while a man who is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit?[6:18] Shun all immorality. Every other sin that people commit is something outside the body; but an immoral person sins against their own body.[6:19] Again, don’t you know that your body is a shrine of the Holy Spirit that is within you – the Spirit which you have from God?[6:20] Moreover, you are not your own masters; you were bought, and the price was paid. Therefore, honour God in your bodies.

 [1 Corinthians 7] 

##### Answers to Questions Asked by the Church at Corinth #####

[7:1] With reference to the subjects about which you wrote to me: It is good for a man to remain single.[7:2] But, owing to the prevalence of immorality, I advise every man to have his own wife, and every woman her husband.[7:3] A husband should give his wife her due, and a wife her husband.[7:4] It is not the wife, but the husband, who exercises power over her body; and so, too, it is not the husband, but the wife, who exercises power over his body.[7:5] Do not deprive each other of what is due – unless it is only for a time and by mutual consent, so that your minds may be free for prayer until you again live as man and wife – otherwise Satan might take advantage of your want of self-control and tempt you.[7:6] I say this, however, as a concession, not as a command.[7:7] I should wish everyone to be just what I am myself. But everyone has his own gift from God – one in one way, and one in another.

[7:8] My advice, then, to those who are not married, and to widows, is this: It would be good for them to remain as I am myself.[7:9] But, if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to be consumed with passion.[7:10] To those who are married my direction is – yet it is not mine, but the Master’s – that a woman is not to leave her husband[7:11] (If she has done so, she should remain as she is, or else be reconciled to her husband) and also that a man is not to divorce his wife.[7:12] To all others I say – I, not the Master – If a follower of the Lord is married to a woman, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with him, he should not divorce her;[7:13] and a woman who is married to a man, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with her, should not divorce her husband.[7:14] For, through his wife, the husband who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ’s people; and the wife who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ’s people through the Lord’s follower whom she has married. Otherwise your children would be “defiled,” but, as it is, they belong to Christ’s people.[7:15] However, if the unbeliever wishes to be separated, let them be so. Under such circumstances neither is bound; God has called you to live in peace.[7:16] How can you tell, wife, whether you may not save your husband? And how can you tell, husband, whether you may not save your wife?

[7:17] In any case, a person should continue to live in the condition which the Lord has allotted to them, and in which they were when God called them. This is the rule that I lay down in every church.[7:18] Was a man already circumcised when he was called? Then he should not efface his circumcision. Has a man been called when uncircumcised? Then he should not be circumcised.[7:19] Circumcision is nothing; the want of it is nothing; but to keep the commands of God is everything.[7:20] Let everyone remain in that condition of life in which they were when the call came to them.[7:21] Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that trouble you. No, even if you are able to gain your freedom, still do your best.[7:22] For the person who was a slave when they were called to the master’s service is the Master’s freedman; so, too, the person who was free when called is Christ’s slave.[7:23] You were bought, and the price was paid. Do not let yourselves become slaves to people.[7:24] Friends, let everyone remain in the condition in which they were when they were called, in close communion with God.

[7:25] With regard to unmarried women, I have no command from the Master to give you, but I tell you my opinion, and the Master in his mercy has made me worthy to be trusted.[7:26] I think, then, that, in view of the time of suffering that has now come upon us, what I have already said is best – that a man should remain as he is.[7:27] Are you married to a wife? Then do not seek to be separated. Are you separated from a wife? Then do not seek for a wife.[7:28] Still, if you should marry, that is not wrong; nor, if a young woman marries, is that wrong. But those who marry will have much trouble to bear, and my wish is to spare you.[7:29] What I mean, friends, is this – the time is short. Meanwhile, let those who have wives live as if they had none,[7:30] those who are weeping as if not weeping, those who are rejoicing as if not rejoicing, those who buy as if not possessing,[7:31] and those who use the good things of the world as using them sparingly; for this world as we see it is passing away.[7:32] I want you to be free from anxiety. The unmarried man is anxious about the Master’s cause, desiring to please him;[7:33] while the married man is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please his wife;[7:34] and so his interests are divided. Again, the unmarried woman, whether she is old or young, is anxious about the Master’s cause, striving to be pure both in body and in spirit, while the married woman is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please her husband.[7:35] I say this for your own benefit, not with any intention of putting a halter round your necks, but in order to secure for the Master seemly and constant devotion, free from all distraction.

[7:36] If, however, a father thinks that he is not acting fairly by his unmarried daughter, when she is past her youth, and if under these circumstances her marriage ought to take place, he should act as he thinks right. He is doing nothing wrong – let the marriage take place.[7:37] On the other hand, a father, who has definitely made up his mind, and is under no compulsion, but is free to carry out his own wishes, and who has come to the decision, in his own mind, to keep his unmarried daughter at home will be doing right.[7:38] In short, the one who consents to his daughter’s marriage is doing right, and yet the other will be doing better.

[7:39] A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives; but, if the husband should pass to his rest, the widow is free to marry anyone she wishes, provided he is a believer.[7:40] Yet she will be happier if she remains as she is – in my opinion, for I think that I also have the Spirit of God.

 [1 Corinthians 8] 


[8:1] With reference to food that has been offered in sacrifice to idols – We are aware that all of us have knowledge! Knowledge breeds conceit, while love builds up character.[8:2] If someone thinks that they know anything, they have not yet reached that knowledge which they ought to have reached.[8:3] On the other hand, if a person loves God, they are known by God.[8:4] With reference, then, to eating food that has been offered to idols – we are aware that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.[8:5] Even supposing that there are so-called “gods” either in heaven or on earth – and there are many such “gods” and “lords” –[8:6] Yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom all things come (and for him we live), and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things come (and through him we live).[8:7] Still, it is not everyone that has this knowledge. Some people, because of their association with idols, continued down to the present time, eat the food as food offered to an idol; and their consciences, while still weak, are dulled.[8:8] What we eat, however, will not bring us nearer to God. We lose nothing by not eating this food, and we gain nothing by eating it.[8:9] But take care that this right of yours does not become in any way a stumbling-block to the weak.[8:10] For if someone should see you who possess this knowledge, feasting in an idol’s temple, will not their conscience, if they are weak, become so hardened that they, too, will eat food offered to idols?[8:11] And so, through this knowledge of yours, the weak person is ruined – someone for whose sake Christ died![8:12] In this way, by sinning against your fellow followers of the Lord and injuring their consciences, while still weak, you sin against Christ.[8:13] Therefore, if what I eat makes a follower of the Lord fall, rather than make them fall, I will never eat meat again.

 [1 Corinthians 9] 


[9:1] Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen our Lord Jesus? Aren’t you yourselves my work achieved in union with the Lord?[9:2] If I am not an apostle to others, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal that stamps me as an apostle in union with the Lord.[9:3] The defence that I make to my critics is this:[9:4] Haven’t we a right to food and drink?[9:5] Haven’t we a right to take a wife with us, if she is a Christian, as the other apostles and the Master’s brothers and Cephas all do?[9:6] Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to give up working for our bread?[9:7] Does anyone ever serve as a soldier at his own expense? Does anyone plant a vineyard and not eat its produce? Or does anyone look after a herd and not drink the milk?[9:8] Am I, in all this, speaking only from the human standpoint? Does not the Law also say the same?[9:9] For in the Law of Moses it is said –

|  “You should not muzzle a bullock while it is treading out the grain.”

Is it the bullocks that God is thinking of?[9:10] Or is not is said entirely for our sakes? Surely it was written for our sakes, for the ploughman ought not to plough, nor the thrasher to thrash, without expecting a share of the grain.[9:11] Since we, then, sowed spiritual seed for you, is it too much that we should reap from you an earthly harvest?[9:12] If others share in this right over you, don’t we even more? Still we did not avail ourselves of this right. No, we endure anything rather than impede the progress of the good news of the Christ.[9:13] Don’t you know that those who do the work of the Temple live on what comes from the Temple, and that those who serve at the altar share the offerings with the altar?[9:14] So, too, the Master has appointed that those who tell the good news should get their living from the good news.[9:15] I, however, have not availed myself of any of these rights. I am not saying this to secure such an arrangement for myself; indeed, I would far rather die – Nobody will make my boast a vain one![9:16] If I tell the good news, I have nothing to boast of, for I am compelled to do so. Woe is me if I do not tell it![9:17] If I do this work willingly, I have a reward; but, if unwillingly, I have been charged to perform a duty.[9:18] What is my reward, then? To present the good news free of all cost, and so make but a sparing use of the rights which it gives me.

[9:19] Although I was entirely free, yet, to win as many converts as possible, I made myself everyone’s slave.[9:20] To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win Jews. To those who are subject to Law I became like a man subject to Law – though I was not myself subject to Law – to win those who are subject to Law.[9:21] To those who have no Law I became like a man who has no Law – not that I am free from God’s Law; no, for I am under Christ’s Law – to win those who have no law.[9:22] To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people, so as at all costs to save some.[9:23] And I do everything for the sake of the good news, so that with them I may share in its blessings.

[9:24] Don’t you know that on a racecourse, though all run, yet only one wins the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.[9:25] Every athlete exercises self-restraint in everything; they, indeed, for a crown that fades, we for one that is unfading.[9:26] I, therefore, run with no uncertain aim. I box – not like a man hitting the air.[9:27] No, I bruise my body and make it my slave, so that I, who have called others to the contest, will not myself be rejected.

 [1 Corinthians 10] 


[10:1] I want you to bear in mind, friends, that all our ancestors were beneath the cloud, and all passed through the sea;[10:2] that in the cloud and in the sea they all underwent baptism as followers of Moses;[10:3] and that they all ate the same supernatural food,[10:4] and all drank the same supernatural water, for they used to drink from a supernatural rock which followed them, and that rock was the Christ.[10:5] Yet with most of them God was displeased; for they were struck down in the desert.[10:6] Now these things happened as warnings to us, to teach us not to long for evil things as our ancestors longed.[10:7] Do not become idolaters, as some of them became. Scripture says –

|  “The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to dance.”

[10:8] Nor let us act immorally, as some of them acted, with the result that twenty-three thousand of them fell dead in a single day.[10:9] Nor let us try the patience of the Lord too far, as some of them tried it, with the result that they were, one after another, destroyed by the snakes.[10:10] And do not murmur, as some of them murmured, and so were destroyed by the angel of death.[10:11] These things happened to them by way of warning, and were recorded to serve as a caution to us, in whose days the close of the ages has come.

[10:12] Therefore let the person who thinks that they stand take care that they do not fall.[10:13] No temptation has come upon you that is not common to all humanity. God will not fail you, and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength; but, when he sends the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape, so that you may have strength to endure.

[10:14] Therefore, my dear friends, shun the worship of idols.[10:15] I speak to you as man of discernment; form your own judgment about what I am saying.[10:16] In the cup of blessing which we bless, is not there a sharing in the blood of the Christ? And in the bread which we break, is not there a sharing in the body of the Christ?[10:17] The bread is one, and we, though many, are one body; for we all partake of that one bread.[10:18] Look at the people of Israel. Do not those who eat the sacrifices share with the altar?[10:19] What do I mean? That an offering made to an idol, or the idol itself, is anything?[10:20] No; what I say is that the sacrifices offered by the Gentiles are offered to demons and to a being who is no God, and I do not want you to share with demons.[10:21] You cannot drink both the Cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake at the Table of the Lord and at the table of demons.[10:22] Or are we to rouse the jealousy of the Lord? Are we stronger than he?

[10:23] Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything does not build up character.[10:24] A person must not study their own interests, but the interests of others.

[10:25] Eat anything that is sold in the market, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples;[10:26] for the earth, with all that is in it, belongs to the Lord.[10:27] If an unbeliever invites you to his house and you consent to go, eat anything that is put before you, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples.[10:28] But, if anyone should say to you “This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol,” then, for the sake of the speaker and his scruples, do not eat it.[10:29] I do not say your scruples, but his. For why should the freedom that I claim be condemned by the scruples of another?[10:30] If, for my part, I take the food thankfully, why should I be abused for eating that for which I give thanks?

[10:31] Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do everything to the honour of God.[10:32] Do not cause offence either to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God;[10:33] for I, also, try to please everybody in everything, not seeking my own advantage, but do what is best for others, so that they may be saved.

 [1 Corinthians 11] 

[11:1] Imitate me, as I myself imitate Christ.

[11:2] I praise you, indeed, because you never forget me, and are keeping my injunctions in mind, exactly as I laid them on you.[11:3] But I am anxious that you should understand that the Christ is the head of every man, that man is the head of woman, and that God is the head of the Christ.[11:4] Any man who keeps his head covered, when praying or preaching in public, dishonours him who is his head;[11:5] while any woman, who prays or preaches in public bare-headed, dishonours him who is her head; for that is to make herself like one of the shameless women who shave their heads.[11:6] Indeed, if a woman does not keep her head covered, she may as well cut her hair short. But, since to cut her hair short, or shave it off, marks her as one of the shameless women, she should keep her head covered.[11:7] A man ought not to have his head covered, for he has been from the beginning the likeness of God and the reflection of his glory, but woman is the reflection of man’s glory.[11:8] For it was not man who was taken from woman, but woman who was taken from man.[11:9] Besides, man was not created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man.[11:10] And, therefore, a woman ought to wear on her head a symbol of her subjection, because of the presence of the angels.[11:11] Still, when in union with the Lord, woman is not independent of man, or man of woman;[11:12] for just as woman came from man, so man comes by means of woman; and all things come from God.[11:13] Judge for yourselves. Is it fitting that a woman should pray to God in public with her head uncovered?[11:14] Does not nature herself teach us that, while for a man to wear his hair long is degrading to him,[11:15] a woman’s long hair is her glory? Her hair has been given her to serve as a covering.[11:16] If, however, anyone still thinks it right to contest the point – well, we have no such custom, nor have the churches of God.

[11:17] In giving directions on the next subject, I cannot praise you; because your meetings do more harm than good.[11:18] To begin with, I am told that when you meet together as a church there are divisions among you. In part I believe this,[11:19] indeed, there must be parties among you, so that the people of real worth become known.[11:20] When you meet together, as I understand, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s Supper;[11:21] for, as you eat, each of you tries to secure his own supper first, with the result that one has too little to eat, and another has too much to drink![11:22] Have you no houses in which you can eat and drink? Or are you trying to show your contempt for the church of God, and to humiliate the poor? What can I say to you? Should I praise you? In this matter I cannot praise you.[11:23] For I myself received from the Lord the account which I have in turn given to you – how the Lord Jesus, on the very night of his betrayal, took some bread,[11:24] and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and said  ‘This is my own body given on your behalf. Do this in memory of me.’ [11:25] And in the same way with the cup, after supper, saying  ‘This cup is the new covenant made by my blood. Do this, whenever you drink it, in memory of me.’ [11:26] For whenever you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death – until he comes.[11:27] Therefore, whoever eats the bread, or drinks the Lord’s cup, in an irreverent spirit, will have to answer for an offence against the Lord’s body and blood.[11:28] Let everyone look into their own heart, and only then eat of the bread and drink from the cup.[11:29] For the person who eats and drinks brings a judgment on themselves by their eating and drinking, when they do not discern the body.[11:30] That is why so many among you are weak and ill, and why some are sleeping.[11:31] But, if we judged ourselves rightly, we should not be judged.[11:32] Yet, in being judged by the Lord, we are undergoing discipline, so that we may not have judgment passed on us with the rest of the world.[11:33] Therefore, my friends, when you meet together to eat the Supper, wait for one another.[11:34] If anyone is hungry, they should eat at home, so that your meetings may not bring a judgment on you. The other details I will settle when I come.

 [1 Corinthians 12] 


[12:1] In the next place, friends, I do not want you to be ignorant about spiritual gifts.[12:2] You know that there was a time when you were Gentiles, going astray after idols that could not speak, just as you happened to be led.[12:3] Therefore I tell you plainly that no one who speaks under the influence of the Spirit of God says “JESUS IS ACCURSED,” and that no one can say “JESUS IS LORD,” except under the influence of the Holy Spirit.[12:4] Gifts differ, but the Spirit is the same;[12:5] ways of serving differ, yet the Master is the same;[12:6] results differ, yet the God who brings about every result is in every case the same.[12:7] To each of us there is given spiritual illumination for the general good.[12:8] To one is given the power to speak with wisdom through the Spirit; to another the power to speak with knowledge, due to the same Spirit;[12:9] to another faith by the same Spirit; to another power to cure diseases by the one Spirit; to another supernatural powers;[12:10] to another the gift of preaching; to another the gift of distinguishing between true and false inspiration; to another varieties of the gift of “tongues”; to another the power to interpret “tongues.”[12:11] All these result from one and the same Spirit, who distributes his gifts to each individually as he wills.

[12:12] For just as the human body is one whole, and yet has many parts, and all its parts, many though they are, form but one body, so it is with the Christ;[12:13] for it was by one Spirit that we were all baptized to form one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free, and were all imbued with one Spirit.[12:14] The human body, I repeat, consists not of one part, but of many.[12:15] If the foot says “Since I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” it does not because of that cease to belong to the body.[12:16] Or if the ear says “Since I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” it does not because of that cease to belong to the body.[12:17] If all the body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If it were all hearing, where would the sense of smell be?[12:18] But in fact God has placed each individual part just where he thought fit in the body.[12:19] If, however, they all made up only one part, where would the body be?[12:20] But in fact, although it has many parts, there is only one body.[12:21] The eye cannot say to the hand “I do not need you,” nor, again, the head to the feet “I do not need you.”[12:22] No! Those parts of the body that seem naturally the weaker are indispensable;[12:23] and those parts which we deem less honourable we surround with special honour; and our ungraceful parts receive a special grace which our graceful parts do not require.[12:24] Yes, God has so constructed the body – by giving a special honour to the part that lacks it –[12:25] As to secure that there should be no disunion in the body, but that the parts should show the same care for one another.[12:26] If one part suffers, all the others suffer with it, and if one part has honour done it, all the others share its joy.[12:27] Together you are the body of Christ, and individually its parts.[12:28] In the church God has appointed, first, apostles, secondly preachers, thirdly teachers; then he has given supernatural powers, then power to cure diseases, aptness for helping others, capacity to govern, varieties of the gift of “tongues.”[12:29] Can everyone be an apostle? Can everyone be a preacher? Can everyone be a teacher? Can everyone have supernatural powers?[12:30] Can everyone have power to cure diseases? Can everyone speak in “tongues”? Can everyone interpret them?[12:31] Strive for the greater gifts.

Yet I can still show you a way beyond all comparison the best.

 [1 Corinthians 13] 

[13:1] Though I speak in the “tongues” of people, or even of angels, yet have not love, I have become mere echoing brass, or a clanging cymbal![13:2] Even though I have the gift of preaching, and fathom all hidden truths and all the depths of knowledge; even though I have such faith as might move mountains, yet have not love, I am nothing![13:3] Even though I dole my substance to the poor, even though I sacrifice my body in order to boast, yet have not love, it avails me nothing![13:4] Love is long-suffering, and kind; love is never envious, never boastful, never conceited, never behaves unbecomingly;[13:5] love is never self-seeking, never provoked, never reckons up her wrongs;[13:6] love never rejoices at evil, but rejoices in the triumph of truth;[13:7] love bears with all things, ever trustful, ever hopeful, ever patient.[13:8] Love never fails. But, whether it be the gift of preaching, it will be done with; whether it be the gift of “tongues,” it will cease; whether it be knowledge, it, too, will be done with.[13:9] For our knowledge is incomplete, and our preaching is incomplete,[13:10] but, when the perfect has come, that which is incomplete will be done with.[13:11] When I was a child, I talked as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; now that I am a man, I have done with childish ways.[13:12] As yet we see, in a mirror, dimly, but then – face to face! As yet my knowledge is incomplete, but then I will know in full, as I have been fully known.[13:13] Meanwhile faith, hope, and love endure – these three, but the greatest of these is love.

 [1 Corinthians 14] 

[14:1] Seek this love earnestly, and strive for spiritual gifts, above all for the gift of preaching.[14:2] The person who, when speaking, uses the gift of “tongues” is speaking, not to people, but to God, for no one understands them; yet in spirit they are speaking of hidden truths.[14:3] But those who preach are speaking to their fellow men and women words that will build up faith, and give them comfort and encouragement.[14:4] Those who, when speaking, use the gift of “tongues” builds up their own faith, while those who preach build up the faith of the church.[14:5] Now I want you all to speak in “tongues,” but much more I wish that you should preach. A preacher is worth more than one who speaks in “tongues,” unless they interprets their words, so that the faith of the church may be built up.[14:6] This being so, friends, what good will I do you, if I come to you and speak in “tongues,” unless my words convey some revelation, or knowledge, or take the form of preaching or teaching?[14:7] Even with inanimate things, such as a flute or a harp, though they produce sounds, yet unless the notes are quite distinct, how can the tune played on the flute or the harp be recognised?[14:8] If the bugle sounds a doubtful call, who will prepare for battle?[14:9] And so with you; unless, in using the gift of “tongues,” you utter intelligible words, how can what you say be understood? You will be speaking to the winds![14:10] There is, for instance, a certain number of different languages in the world, and not one of them fails to convey meaning.[14:11] If, however, I do not happen to know the language, I will be a foreigner to those who speak it, and they will be foreigners to me.[14:12] And so with you; since your are striving for spiritual gifts, be eager to excel in such as will build up the faith of the church.[14:13] Therefore anyone who, when speaking, uses the gift of “tongues” should pray for ability to interpret them.[14:14] If, when praying, I use the gift of “tongues,” my spirit indeed prays, but my mind is a blank.[14:15] What, then, is my conclusion? Simply this – I will pray with my spirit, but with my mind as well; I will sing with my spirit, but with my mind as well.[14:16] If you bless God with your spirit only, how can people in the congregation who are without your gift say “Amen” to your thanksgiving? They do not know what you are saying![14:17] Your thanksgiving may be excellent, but the other is not helped by it.[14:18] Thank God, I use the gift of “tongues” more than any of you.[14:19] But at a meeting of the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, and so teach others, than ten thousand words when using the gift of “tongues.”

[14:20] My friends, do not show yourselves children in understanding. In wickedness be infants, but in understanding show yourselves adults.[14:21] It is said in the Law –

|  “In strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.”

[14:22] Therefore the gift of the “tongues” is intended as a sign, not for those who believe in Christ, but for those who do not, while the gift of preaching is intended as a sign, not for those who do not believe in Christ, but for those who do.[14:23] So, when the whole church meets, if all present use the gift of “tongues,” and some people who are without the gift, or who are unbelievers, come in, will not they say that you are mad?[14:24] While, if all those present use the gift of preaching, and an unbeliever, or someone without the gift, comes in, they are convinced of their sinfulness by them all, they are called to account by them all;[14:25] the secrets of their heart are revealed, and then, throwing themselves on their face, they will worship God, and declare “God is indeed among you!”

[14:26] What do I suggest, then, friends? Whenever you meet for worship, each of you comes, either with a hymn, or a lesson, or a revelation, or the gift of “tongues,” or the interpretation of them; let everything be directed to the building up of faith.[14:27] If any of you use the gift of “tongues,” not more than two, or at the most three, should do so – each speaking in his turn – and someone should interpret them.[14:28] If there is no one able to interpret what is said, they should remain silent at the meeting of the church, and speak to themselves and to God.[14:29] Of preachers two or three should speak, and the rest should weigh well what is said.[14:30] But, if some revelation is made to another person as he sits there, the first speaker should stop.[14:31] For you can all preach in turn, so that all may learn some lesson and all receive encouragement.[14:32] (The spirit that moves the preachers is within the preachers’ control;[14:33] for God is not a God of disorder, but of peace.) This custom prevails in all the churches of Christ’s people.

[14:34] At the meetings of the church married women should remain silent, for they are not allowed to speak in public; they should take a subordinate place, as the Law itself directs.[14:35] If they want information on any point, they should ask their husbands about it at home; for it is unbecoming for a married woman to speak at a meeting of the church.[14:36] What! Did God’s message to the world originate with you? Or did it find its way to none but you?

[14:37] If anyone thinks that he has the gift of preaching or any other spiritual gift, he should recognise that what I am now saying to you is a command from the Lord.[14:38] Anyone who ignores it may be ignored.[14:39] Therefore, my friends, strive for the gift of preaching, and yet do not forbid speaking in “tongues.”[14:40] Let everything be done in a proper and orderly manner.

 [1 Corinthians 15] 

##### The Apostle’s Teaching as to the Resurrection of the Dead #####

[15:1] Next, friends, I would like to remind you of the good news which I told you, and which you received – the good news on which you have taken your stand,[15:2] and by means of which you are being saved. I would like to remind you of the words that I used in telling it to you, since you are still holding fast to it, and since it was not in vain that you became believers in Christ.[15:3] For at the very beginning of my teaching I gave you the account which I had myself received – that Christ died for our sins (as the scriptures had foretold),[15:4] that he was buried, that on the third day he was raised (as the scriptures had foretold),[15:5] and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.[15:6] After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have gone to their rest.[15:7] After that, he appeared to James, and then to all the apostles.[15:8] Last of all, he appeared even to me, who am, as it were, the abortion.[15:9] For I am the meanest of the apostles, I who am unworthy of the name of “apostle,” because I persecuted the church of God.[15:10] But it is through the love of God that I am what I am, and the love that he showed me has not been wasted. No, I have toiled harder than any of them, and yet it was not I, but the love of God working with me.[15:11] Whether, then, it was I or whether it was they, this we proclaim, and this you believed.

[15:12] Now, if it is proclaimed of Christ that he has been raised from the dead, how is it that some of you say that there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead?[15:13] But, if there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead, then even Christ has not been raised;[15:14] and, if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is without meaning, and our faith without meaning also![15:15] Yes, and we are being proved to have borne false testimony about God; for we testified of God that he raised the Christ, whom he did not raise, if, indeed, the dead do not rise![15:16] For, if the dead do not rise, then even Christ himself has not been raised,[15:17] and, if Christ has not been raised, your faith is folly – your sins are on you still![15:18] Yes, and they, who have passed to their rest in union with Christ, perished![15:19] If all that we have done has been to place our hope in Christ for this life, then we of all people are the most to be pitied.

[15:20] But, in truth, Christ has been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of those who are at rest.[15:21] For, since through a man there is death, so, too, through a man there is a resurrection of the dead.[15:22] For, as through union with Adam all die, so through union with the Christ will all be made to live.[15:23] But each in their proper order – Christ the first-fruits; afterwards, at his coming, those who belong to the Christ.[15:24] Then will come the end – when he surrenders the kingdom to his God and Father, having overthrown all other rule and all other authority and power.[15:25] For he must reign until God “has put all his enemies under his feet.”[15:26] The last enemy to be overthrown is death;[15:27] for God has placed all things under Christ’s feet. (But, when it is said that all things have been placed under Christ, it is plain that God is excepted who placed everything under him.)[15:28] And, when everything has been placed under him, the Son will place himself under God who placed everything under him, so that God may be all in all![15:29] Again, what good will they be doing who are baptized on behalf of the dead? If it is true that the dead do not rise, why are people baptized on their behalf?[15:30] Why, too, do we risk our lives every hour?[15:31] Daily I face death – I swear it, friends, by the pride in you that I feel through my union with Christ Jesus, our Lord.[15:32] If with only human hopes I had fought in the arena at Ephesus, what should I have gained by it? If the dead do not rise, then let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die![15:33] Do not be deceived.

|  “Good character is marred by evil company.”

[15:34] Wake up to a righteous life, and cease to sin. There are some who have no true knowledge of God. I speak in this way to shame you.

[15:35] Someone, however, may ask “How do the dead rise? And in what body will they come?”[15:36] You foolish person! The seed you yourself sow does not come to life, unless it dies![15:37] And when you sow, you sow not the body that will be, but a mere grain – perhaps of wheat, or something else.[15:38] God gives it the body that he pleases – to each seed its special body.[15:39] All forms of life are not the same; there is one for people, another for beasts, another for birds, and another for fish.[15:40] There are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the beauty of the heavenly bodies is not the beauty of the earthly.[15:41] There is a beauty of the sun, and a beauty of the moon, and a beauty of the stars; for even star differs from star in beauty.[15:42] It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. Sown a mortal body, it rises immortal; sown disfigured, it rises beautiful;[15:43] sown weak, it rises strong; sown a human body, it rises a spiritual body.[15:44] As surely as there is a human body, there is also a spiritual body.[15:45] That is what is meant by the words – “Adam, the first man, became a human being”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.[15:46] That which comes first is not the spiritual, but the human; afterwards comes the spiritual;[15:47] the first man was from the dust of the earth; the second man from heaven.[15:48] Those who are of the dust are like him who came from the dust; and those who are of heaven are like him who came from heaven.[15:49] And as we have borne the likeness of him who came from the dust, so let us bear the likeness of him who came from heaven.[15:50] This I say, friends – Flesh and blood can have no share in the kingdom of God, nor can the perishable share the imperishable.[15:51] Listen, I will tell you God’s hidden purpose! We will not all have passed to our rest, but we will all be transformed – in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,[15:52] at the last trumpet-call; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will rise immortal, and we, also, will be transformed.[15:53] For this perishable body of ours must put on an imperishable form, and this dying body a deathless form.[15:54] And, when this dying body has put on its deathless form, then indeed will the words of scripture come true –

|  [15:55] “death has been swallowed up in victory! Where, Death, is your victory? Where, death, is your sting?”

[15:56] It is sin that gives death its sting, and it is the Law that gives sin its power.[15:57] But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.[15:58] Therefore, my dear friends, stand firm, unshaken, always diligent in the Lord’s work, for you know that, in union with him, your toil is not in vain.

 [1 Corinthians 16] 

##### Conclusion #####

[16:1] With reference to the collection for Christ’s people, I want you to follow the instructions that I gave to the churches in Galatia.[16:2] On the first day of every week each of you should put by what he can afford, so that no collections need be made after I have come.[16:3] On my arrival, I will send any persons, whom you may authorise by letter, to carry your gift to Jerusalem;[16:4] and, if it appears to be worth while for me to go also, they will go with me.

[16:5] I will come to you as soon as I have been through Macedonia – for I am going through Macedonia –[16:6] And I will probably make some stay with you or, perhaps, remain for the winter, so that you may yourselves send me on my way, wherever I may be going.[16:7] I do not propose to pay you a visit in passing now, for I hope to stay with you for some time, if the Lord permits.[16:8] I intend, however, staying at Ephesus until the Festival at the close of the Harvest;[16:9] for a great opening for active work has presented itself, and there are many opponents.

[16:10] If Timothy comes, take care that he has no cause for feeling anxious while he is with you. He is doing the Master’s work no less than I am.[16:11] No one, therefore, should slight him. See him safely on his way to me, for I am expecting him with some of our friends.

[16:12] As for our friend Apollos, I have often urged him to go to you with the others. He has, however, been very unwilling to do so as yet; but he will go as soon as he finds a good opportunity.

[16:13] Be watchful; stand firm in your faith; be brave; be strong.[16:14] Let everything you do be done in a loving spirit.

[16:15] I have another request to make of you, friends. You remember Stephanas and his household, and that they were the first-fruits gathered in from Greece, and set themselves to serve Christ’s people.[16:16] I want you, on your part, to show deference to such people as these, as well as to every fellow labourer and earnest worker.[16:17] I am glad Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come, for they have made up for your absence;[16:18] they have cheered my heart, and your hearts also. Recognise the worth of such people as these.

[16:19] The churches in Roman Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and Prisca and the church that meets at their house send you many Christian greetings.[16:20] All of the Lord’s followers send you greetings. Greet one another with a sacred kiss.

[16:21] I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting.[16:22] Accursed be anyone who has no love for the Lord. THE LORD IS COMING.[16:23] May the blessing of the Lord Jesus be with you.[16:24] My love to all of you who are in union with Christ Jesus.


Paul’s Second Letter to the
---------------------------

Corinthians
===========

 [2 Corinthians 1] 

##### Introduction #####

[1:1] To the church of God in Corinth, and to all Christ’s people throughout Greece, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and from Timothy, who is also a follower.[1:2] May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.

[1:3] Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-merciful Father, the God ever ready to console,[1:4] who consoles us in all our troubles, so that we may be able to console those who are in any trouble with the consolation that we ourselves receive from him.[1:5] It is true that we have our full share of the sufferings of the Christ, but through the Christ we have also our full share of consolation.[1:6] If we meet with trouble, it is for the sake of your consolation and salvation; and, if we find consolation, it is for the sake of the consolation that you will experience when you are called to endure the sufferings that we ourselves are enduring;[1:7] and our hope for you remains unshaken. We know that, as you are sharing our sufferings, you will also share our consolation.[1:8] We want you, friends, to know that, in the troubles which befell us in Roman Asia, we were burdened altogether beyond our strength, so much so that we even despaired of life.[1:9] Indeed, we had the presentiment that we must die, so that we might rely, not on ourselves, but on God who raises the dead.[1:10] And from so imminent a death God delivered us, and will deliver us again; for in him we have placed our hopes of future deliverance, while you, also, help us by your prayers.[1:11] And then many lips will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to many prayers.

##### The Apostle’s Relations with his Converts #####

[1:12] Indeed, our main ground for satisfaction is this – Our conscience tells us that our conduct in the world, and still more in our relations with you, was marked by a purity of motive and a sincerity that were inspired by God, and was based, not on worldly policy, but on the help of God.[1:13] We never write anything to you other than what you will acknowledge to the very end –[1:14] And, indeed, you have already partly acknowledged it about us – that you have a right to be proud of us, as we will be proud of you, on the day of our Lord Jesus.

[1:15] With this conviction in my mind, I planned to come to see you first, so that your pleasure might be doubled –[1:16] To visit you both on my way to Macedonia, and to come to you again on my return from Macedonia, and then to get you to send me on my way into Judea.[1:17] As this was my plan, where, pray, did I show any fickleness of purpose? Or do you think that my plans are formed on mere impulse, so that in the same breath I say “Yes” and “No”?[1:18] As God is true, the message that we brought you does not waver between “Yes” and “No”![1:19] The Son of God, Christ Jesus, whom we – Silas, Timothy, and I – proclaimed among you, never wavered between “Yes” and “No.” With him it has always been “Yes.”[1:20] For, many as were the promises of God, in Christ is the “Yes” that fulfils them. Therefore, through Christ again, let the “Amen” rise, through us, to the glory of God.[1:21] God who brings us, with you, into close union with Christ, and who consecrated us,[1:22] also set his seal on us, and gave us his Spirit in our hearts as a pledge of future blessings.

[1:23] But, as my life will answer for it, I call God to witness that it was to spare you that I deferred my visit to Corinth.[1:24] I do not mean that we are to dictate to you with regard to your faith; on the contrary, we work with you for your true happiness; indeed, it is through your faith that you are standing firm.

 [2 Corinthians 2] 

[2:1] For my own sake, as well, I decided not to pay you another painful visit.[2:2] If it is I who cause you pain, why, who is there to cheer me, except the person whom I am paining?[2:3] So I wrote as I did because I was afraid that if I had come, I should have been pained by those who ought to have made me glad; for I felt sure that it was true of you all that my joy was in every case yours also.[2:4] I wrote to you in sore trouble and distress of heart and with many tears, not to give you pain, but to let you see how intense a love I have for you.

[2:5] Now whoever has caused the pain has not so much pained me, as he has, to some extent – not to be too severe – pained every one of you.[2:6] The man to whom I refer has been sufficiently punished by the penalty inflicted by the majority of you;[2:7] so that now you must take the opposite course, and forgive and encourage him, or else he may be overwhelmed by the intensity of his pain.[2:8] So I entreat you to assure him of your love.[2:9] I had this further object, also, in what I wrote – to find out whether you might be relied on to be obedient in everything.[2:10] Anyone you forgive, I forgive them, too. Indeed, for my part, whatever I have forgiven (if I have had to forgive anything), I have forgiven for your sakes, in the presence of Christ,[2:11] so as to prevent Satan from taking advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.

[2:12] When I went to the district round Troas to tell the good news of the Christ, even though there was an opening for serving the Master,[2:13] I could get no peace of mind because I failed to find Titus, my friend; so I took leave of the people there, and went on to Macedonia.[2:14] All thanks to God, who, through our union with the Christ, leads us in one continual triumph, and uses us to spread the sweet perfume of the knowledge of him in every place.[2:15] For we are the fragrance of Christ ascending to God – both among those who are in the path of salvation and among those who are in the path to ruin.[2:16] To the latter we are a stench which arises from death and tells of death; to the former a fragrance which arises from life and tells of life. But who is equal to such a task?[2:17] Unlike many people, we are not in the habit of making profit out of God’s message; but in all sincerity, and bearing God’s commission, we speak before him in union with Christ.

 [2 Corinthians 3] 


[3:1] Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or are we like some who need letters of commendation to you, or from you?[3:2] You yourselves are our letter – a letter written on our hearts, and one which everybody can read and understand.[3:3] All can see that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, a letter written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.

##### The Ministry of the Apostles #####

[3:4] This, then, is the confidence in regard to God that we have gained through the Christ.[3:5] I do not mean that we are fit to form any judgment by ourselves, as if on our own authority;[3:6] our fitness comes from God, who himself made us fit to be assistants of a new covenant, of which the substance is, not a written Law, but a Spirit. For the written Law means death, but the Spirit gives life.

[3:7] If the system of religion which involved death, embodied in a written Law and engraved on stones, began amid such glory, that the Israelites were unable to gaze at the face of Moses because of its glory, though it was but a passing glory,[3:8] will not the religion that confers the Spirit have still greater glory?[3:9] For, if there was a glory in the religion that involved condemnation, far greater is the glory of the religion that confers righteousness![3:10] Indeed, that which then had glory has lost its glory, because of the glory which surpasses it.[3:11] And, if that which was to pass away was attended with glory, far more will that which is to endure be surrounded with glory!

[3:12] With such a hope as this, we speak with all plainness;[3:13] unlike Moses, who covered his face with a veil, to prevent the Israelites from gazing at the disappearance of what was passing away.[3:14] But their minds were slow to learn. Indeed, to this very day, at the public reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains; only for those who are in union with Christ does it pass away.[3:15] But, even to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their hearts.[3:16] Yet, whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.[3:17] And the Lord is the Spirit, and, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.[3:18] And all of us, with faces from which the veil is lifted, seeing, as if reflected in a mirror, the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness, from glory to glory, as it is given by the Lord, the Spirit.

 [2 Corinthians 4] 

[4:1] Therefore, since it is by God’s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart.[4:2] No, we have renounced the secrecy prompted by shame, refusing to adopt crafty ways, or to tamper with God’s message, and commending ourselves to everyone’s conscience, in the sight of God, by our exhibition of the truth.[4:3] And, even if the good news that we bring is veiled, it is veiled only in the case of those who are on the path to ruin –[4:4] people whose minds have been blinded by the God of this age, unbelievers as they are, so that the light from the good news of the glory of the Christ, who is the incarnation of God, should not shine for them.[4:5] (For it is not ourselves that we proclaim, but Christ Jesus, as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.)[4:6] Indeed, the same God who said “Out of darkness light will shine,” has shone in on our hearts, so that we should bring out into the light the knowledge of the glory of God, seen in the face of Christ.

[4:7] This treasure we have in these earthen vessels, so that its all-prevailing power may be seen to come from God, and not to be our own.[4:8] Though hard pressed on every side, we are never hemmed in; though perplexed, never driven to despair;[4:9] though pursued, never abandoned; though struck down, never killed![4:10] We always bear on our bodies the marks of the death that Jesus died, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our bodies.[4:11] Indeed, we who still live are continually being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our mortal nature.[4:12] And so, while death is at work within us, life is at work within you.[4:13] But, in the same spirit of faith as that expressed in the words – “I believed, and therefore I spoke,” we, also believe, and therefore speak.[4:14] For we know that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with him, and will bring us, with you, into his presence.[4:15] For all this is for your sakes, so that the loving kindness of God, spreading from heart to heart, may cause yet more hearts to overflow with thanksgiving, to his glory.

[4:16] Therefore, as I said, we do not lose heart. No, even though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.[4:17] The light burden of our momentary trouble is preparing for us, in measure transcending thought, a weight of imperishable glory;[4:18] we, all the while, gazing not on what is seen, but on what is unseen; for what is seen is transient, but what is unseen is imperishable.

 [2 Corinthians 5] 

[5:1] For we know that if our tent – that earthly body which is now our home – is taken down, we have a house of God’s building, a home not made by hands, imperishable, in heaven.[5:2] Even while in our present body we sigh, longing to put over it our heavenly house,[5:3] sure that, when we have put it on, we will never be found discarnate.[5:4] For we who are in this tent sigh under our burden, unwilling to take it off, yet wishing to put our heavenly body over it, so that all that is mortal may be absorbed in life.[5:5] And he who has prepared us for this change is God, who has also given us his Spirit as a pledge.

[5:6] Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, while our home is in the body, we are absent from our home with the Lord.[5:7] For we guide our lives by faith, and not by what we see.[5:8] And in this confidence we would gladly leave our home in the body, and make our home with the Lord.[5:9] Therefore, whether in our home or absent from our home, our one ambition is to please him.[5:10] For at the court of the Christ we must all appear in our true characters, so that each may reap the results of the life which he has lived in the body, in accordance with his actions – whether good or worthless.

[5:11] Therefore, because we know the fear inspired by the Lord, it is true that we are trying to win people over, but our motives are plain to God; and I hope that in your inmost hearts they are plain to you also.[5:12] We are not ‘commending ourselves’ again to you, but rather are giving you cause for pride in us, so that you may have an answer ready for those who pride themselves on appearances and not on character.[5:13] For, if we were ‘beside ourselves,’ it was in God’s service! If we are not in our senses, it is in yours![5:14] It is the love of the Christ which compels us, when we reflect that, as one died for all, therefore all died;[5:15] and that he died for all, so that the living should no longer live for themselves, but for him who died and rose for them.

[5:16] For ourselves, then, from this time forward, we refuse to regard anyone from the world’s standpoint. Even if we once thought of Christ from the standpoint of the world, yet now we do so no longer.[5:17] Therefore, if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new being! His old life has passed away; a new life has begun![5:18] But all this is the work of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave us the Ministry of Reconciliation –[5:19] To proclaim that God, in Christ, was reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning people’s offences against them, and that he had entrusted us with the message of this reconciliation.

[5:20] It is, then, on Christ’s behalf that we are acting as ambassadors, God, as it were, appealing to you through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf – Be reconciled to God.[5:21] For our sake God made Christ, who was innocent of sin, one with our sinfulness, so that in him we might be made one with the righteousness of God.

 [2 Corinthians 6] 

[6:1] Therefore, as God’s fellow workers, we also appeal to you not to receive his loving kindness in vain.[6:2] For he says –

|  “At the time for acceptance I listened to you,
|  and on the day of deliverance I helped you.”

Now is the time for acceptance! Now is the day of deliverance![6:3] Never do we put an obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry.[6:4] No, we are trying to commend ourselves under all circumstances, as God’s assistants should – in many an hour of endurance, in troubles, in hardships, in difficulties,[6:5] in floggings, in imprisonments, in riots, in toils, in sleepless nights, in fastings;[6:6] by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindliness, by holiness of spirit, by unfeigned love;[6:7] by the message of truth, and by the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;[6:8] amid honour and disrepute, amid slander and praise; regarded as deceivers, yet proved to be true;[6:9] as unknown, yet well-known; as at death’s door, yet, see, we are living; as chastised, yet not killed;[6:10] as saddened, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things!

##### The Apostle and his Converts #####

[6:11] We have been speaking freely to you, dear friends in Corinth; we have opened our heart;[6:12] there is room there for you, yet there is not room, in your love, for us.[6:13] Can you not in return – I appeal to you as I should to children – open your hearts to us?

[6:14] Do not enter into inconsistent relations with those who reject the faith. For what partnership can there be between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what has light to do with darkness?[6:15] What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial? Or what can those who accept the faith have in common with those who reject it?[6:16] What agreement can you be between a temple of God and idols? And we are a temple of the living God. That is what God meant when he said –

|  “I will live among them, and walk among them;
|    and I will be their God, and they will be my people.
|  [6:17] Therefore ‘Come out from among the nations, and separate yourselves from them,’ says the Lord,
|  ‘And touch nothing impure;
|    and I will welcome you;
|  [6:18] and I will be a father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters,’
|    says the Lord, the Ruler of all.”

 [2 Corinthians 7] 

[7:1] With these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that pollutes either body or spirit, and, in deepest respect for God, aim at perfect holiness.

[7:2] Make room for us in your hearts. In no instance have we ever wronged, or harmed, or taken advantage of, anyone.[7:3] I am not saying this to condemn you. Indeed, I have already said that you are in our heart, to live and die together.[7:4] I have the utmost confidence in you; I am always boasting about you. I am full of encouragement and, in spite of all our troubles, my heart is overflowing with happiness.

[7:5] Ever since we reached Macedonia, we have had no rest in body or mind; on every side there have been troubles – conflicts without, anxieties within.[7:6] But God, who encourages the downcast, has encouraged us by the arrival of Titus.[7:7] And it is not only by his arrival that we are encouraged, but also by the encouragement which he received from you; for he tells us of your strong affection, your penitence, and your zeal on my behalf – so that I am happier still.[7:8] For, though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Even if I were inclined to regret it – for I see that my letter did cause you sorrow though only for a time –[7:9] I am glad now; not because of the sorrow it caused you, but because your sorrow brought you to repentance. For it was God’s will that you should feel sorrow, in order that you should not suffer loss in any way at our hands.[7:10] For, when sorrow is in accordance with God’s will, it results in a repentance leading to salvation, and which will never be regretted. The sure result of the sorrow that the world knows is death.[7:11] For see what results that other sorrow – sorrow in accordance with God’s will – has had in your case. What earnestness it produced! What explanations! What strong feeling! What alarm! What longing! What eagerness! What readiness to punish! You have proved yourselves altogether free from guilt in that matter.[7:12] So, then, even though I did write to you, it was not for the sake of the wrong-doer, or of the man who was wronged, but to make you conscious, in the sight of God, of your own earnest care for us. And it is this that has encouraged us.

[7:13] In addition to the encouragement that this gave us, we were made far happier still by the happiness of Titus for his heart has been cheered by you all.[7:14] Although I have been boasting a little to him about you, you did not put me to shame; but, just as every thing we had said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus about you has also proved to be the truth.[7:15] And his affection for you is all the greater, as he remembers the deference that you all showed him, and recalls how you received him with anxious care.[7:16] I am glad that I can feel perfect confidence in you.

 [2 Corinthians 8] 

##### The Palestine Famine Fund #####

[8:1] We want to remind you, friends, of the love that God has shown to the churches in Macedonia –[8:2] How, tired though they were by many a trouble, their overflowing happiness, and even their deep poverty, resulted in a flood of generosity.[8:3] I can bear witness that to the full extent of their power, and even beyond their power, spontaneously,[8:4] and with many an appeal to us for permission, they showed their love, and contributed their share towards the fund for their fellow Christians.[8:5] And that, not only in the way we had expected; but first they gave themselves to the Lord, and to us also, in accordance with God’s will.[8:6] And this led us beg Titus, since he had started the work for you, he should also see to the completion of this expression of your love.[8:7] And, remembering how you excel in everything – in faith, in teaching, in knowledge, in unfailing earnestness, and in the affection that we have awakened in you – I ask you to excel also in this expression of your love.

[8:8] I am not laying a command on you, but I am making use of the earnestness shown by others to test the genuineness of your affection.[8:9] For you do not forget the loving kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ – how that for your sakes, although he was rich, he became poor, so that you also might become rich through his poverty.[8:10] I am only making suggestions on this matter; for this is the best course for you, since you were a year before others, not only in taking action, but also in showing your readiness to do so.[8:11] And now I want you to complete the work, so that its completion may correspond with your willing readiness – in proportion, of course, to your means.[8:12] For, where there is willingness, a person’s gift is valued by its comparison with what they have, and not with what they do not have.[8:13] For our object is not to give relief to others and bring distress on you. It is a matter of a fair balance.[8:14] On this occasion what you can spare will supply what they need, at another time what they can spare may supply your need, and so things will be equal.[8:15] As scripture says –

|  “Those who had much had nothing over, and those who had little did not lack!”

[8:16] I thank God for inspiring Titus with the same keen interest in your welfare that I have;[8:17] for Titus has responded to my appeals and, in his great earnestness, is starting to go to you of his own accord.[8:18] We are sending with him one of the Lord’s followers whose fame in the service of the good news has spread through all the churches;[8:19] and not only that, but he has been elected by the churches to accompany us on our journey, in connexion with this expression of your love, which we are personally administering to the honour of the Lord, and to show our deep interest.[8:20] What we are specially guarding against is that any fault should be found with us in regard to our administration of this charitable fund;[8:21] for we are trying to make arrangements which will be right, not only in the eyes of the Lord, but also in the eyes of people.[8:22] We are also sending with them another of our friends, whose earnestness we have many a time proved in many ways, and whom we now find made even more earnest by his great confidence in you.[8:23] If I must say anything about Titus, he is my intimate companion, and he shares my work for you; if it is our friends, they are delegates of the churches, an honour to Christ.[8:24] Show them, therefore – so that the churches may see it – the proof of your affection, and the ground for our boasting to them about you.

 [2 Corinthians 9] 

[9:1] With reference, indeed, to the Fund for your fellow Christians, it is quite superfluous for me to say anything to you.[9:2] I know, of course, your willingness to help, and I am always boasting of it to the Macedonians. I tell them that you in Greece have been ready for a year past; and it was really your zeal that stimulated most of them.[9:3] So my reason for sending our friends is to prevent what we said about you from proving, in this particular matter, an empty boast, and to enable you to be as well prepared as I have been saying that you are.[9:4] Otherwise, if any Macedonians were to come with me, and find you unprepared, we – to say nothing of you – should feel ashamed of our present confidence.[9:5] Therefore I think it necessary to beg the friends to go to you in advance, and to complete the arrangements for the gift, which you have already promised, so that it may be ready, as a gift, before I come, and not look as if it were being given under pressure.

[9:6] Remember the saying – “Scanty sowing, scanty harvest; plentiful sowing, plentiful harvest.”[9:7] Let everyone give as he has determined before hand, not grudgingly or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.[9:8] God has power to shower all kinds of blessings on you, so that, having, under all circumstances and on all occasions, all that you can need, you may be able to shower all kinds of benefits on others.[9:9] (As scripture says –

|  “He scattered broadcast, he gave to the poor; His righteousness continues for ever.”

[9:10] And he who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for eating, will supply you with seed, and cause it to increase, and will multiply the fruits of your righteousness).[9:11] Rich in all things yourselves, you will be able to show liberality to all, which, with our help, will cause thanksgiving to be offered to God.[9:12] For the rendering of a public service such as this, not only relieves the needs of your fellow Christians, but also results in the offering to God of many a thanksgiving.[9:13] Through the evidence afforded by the service rendered, you cause people to praise God for your fidelity to your profession of faith in the good news of the Christ, as well as for the liberality of your contributions for them and for all others.[9:14] And they also, in their prayers for you, express their longing to see you, because of the surpassing love of God displayed toward you.[9:15] All thanks to God for his inestimable gift!

 [2 Corinthians 10] 

##### The Apostle’s Claims and Authority #####

[10:1] Now, I, Paul, make a personal appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ – I who, ‘in your presence, am humble in my bearing towards you, but, when absent, am bold in my language to you’ –[10:2] I implore you not to drive me to ‘show my boldness,’ when I do come, by the confident tone which I expect to have to adopt towards some of you, who are expecting to find us influenced in our conduct by earthly motives.[10:3] For, though we live an earthly life, we do not wage an earthly war.[10:4] The weapons for our warfare are not earthly, but, under God, are powerful enough to pull down strongholds.[10:5] We are engaged in confuting arguments and pulling down every barrier raised against the knowledge of God. We are taking captive every hostile thought, to bring it into submission to the Christ,[10:6] and are fully prepared to punish every act of rebellion, when once your submission is complete.[10:7] You look at the outward appearance of things! Let anyone, who is confident that he belongs to Christ, reflect, for himself, again on the fact – that we belong to Christ no less than he does.[10:8] Even if I boast extravagantly about our authority – which the Lord gave us for building up your faith and not for overthrowing it – still I have no reason to be ashamed.[10:9] I say this so that it doesn’t seem as if I am trying to overawe you by my letters.[10:10] For people say ‘His letters are impressive and vigorous, but his personal appearance is insignificant and his speaking contemptible.’[10:11] Let such a person be assured of this – that our words in our letters show us to be, when absent, just what our deeds will show us to be, when present.[10:12] We have not indeed the audacity to class or compare ourselves with some of those who indulge in self-commendation! But, when such persons measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they show a want of wisdom.[10:13] We, however, will not give way to unlimited boasting, but will confine ourselves to the limits of the sphere to which God limited us, when he permitted us to come as far as Corinth.[10:14] For it is not the case, as it would be if we were not in the habit of coming to you, that we are exceeding our bounds! Why, we were the very first to reach you with the good news of the Christ![10:15] Our boasting, therefore, is not unlimited, nor does it extend to the labours of others; but our hope is that, as your faith grows, our influence among you may be very greatly increased – though still confined to our sphere –[10:16] So that we will be able to tell the good news in the districts beyond you, without trespassing on the sphere assigned to others, or boasting of what has been already done.[10:17] Let anyone who boasts make their boast of the Lord.[10:18] For it is not those who commend themselves that stand the test, but those who are commended by the Lord.

 [2 Corinthians 11] 


[11:1] I could wish that you would tolerate a little folly in me! But indeed you do tolerate me.[11:2] I am jealous over you with the jealousy of God. For I engaged you to one husband so that I might present you to the Christ a pure bride.[11:3] Yet I fear that it may turn out that, just as the snake by his craftiness deceived Eve, so your minds may have lost the loyalty and purity due from you to the Christ.[11:4] For, if some newcomer is proclaiming a Jesus other than him whom we proclaimed, or if you are receiving a Spirit different from the Spirit which you received, or a good news different from that which you welcomed, then you are marvellously tolerant![11:5] I do not regard myself as in any way inferior to the most eminent apostles![11:6] Though I am no trained orator, yet I am not without knowledge; indeed we made this perfectly clear to you in every way.

[11:7] Perhaps you say that I did wrong in humbling myself that you might be exalted – I mean because I told you God’s good news without payment.[11:8] I robbed other churches by taking pay from them, so that I might serve you![11:9] And, when I was with you in need, I did not become a burden to any of you; for our friends, on coming from Macedonia, supplied my needs. I kept myself, and will keep myself from being an expense to you in any way.[11:10] As surely as I know anything of the truth of Christ, this boast, as far as I am concerned, will not be stopped in any part of Greece.[11:11] Why? Because I do not love you? God knows that I do!

[11:12] What I am doing now I will continue to do in order to cut away the ground from under those who are wishing for some ground for attacking me, so that as regards the thing of which they boast they may appear in their true characters, just as we do.[11:13] Such people are false apostles, treacherous workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ![11:14] And no wonder; for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.[11:15] It is not surprising, therefore, if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. But their end will be in accordance with their actions.

[11:16] I say again – Let no one think me a fool! Yet, if you do, at least welcome me as you would a fool, so that I, too may indulge in a little boasting.[11:17] When I speak like this, I am not speaking as the Master would, but as a fool might, in boasting so confidently.[11:18] As so many are boasting of earthly things, I, too, will boast.[11:19] For all your cleverness, you tolerate fools willingly enough![11:20] You tolerate a person even when they enslave you, when they plunder you, when they get you into their power, when they put on airs of superiority, when they strike you in the face![11:21] I admit, to my shame, that we have been weak. But whatever the subject on which others are not afraid to boast – though it is foolish to say so – I am not afraid either![11:22] Are they Hebrews? So am I! Are they Israelites? So am I! Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I![11:23] Are they “Servants of Christ”? Though it is madness to talk like this, I am more so than they! I have had more of toil, more of imprisonment! I have been flogged times without number. I have been often at death’s door.[11:24] Five times I received at the hands of my own people forty lashes, all but one.[11:25] Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. I have spent a whole day and night in the deep.[11:26] My journeys have been many. I have been through dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in towns, dangers in the country, dangers on the sea, dangers among people pretending to be followers of the Lord.[11:27] I have been through toil and hardship. I have passed many a sleepless night; I have endured hunger and thirst; I have often been without food; I have known cold and nakedness.[11:28] And, not to speak of other things, there is my daily burden of anxiety about all the churches.[11:29] Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led astray without my burning with indignation?[11:30] If I must boast, I will boast of things which show my weakness![11:31] The God and Father of the Lord Jesus – he who is for ever blessed – knows that I am speaking the truth.[11:32] When I was in Damascus, the Governor under King Aretas had the gates of that city guarded, so as to arrest me,[11:33] but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and so escaped his hands.

 [2 Corinthians 12] 

[12:1] I must boast! It is unprofitable; but I will pass to visions and revelations given by the Lord.[12:2] I know a man in union with Christ, who, fourteen years ago – whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows – was caught up (this man of whom I am speaking) to the third heaven.[12:3] And I know that this man – whether in the body or separated from the body I do not know; God knows –[12:4] Was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable things of which no human being may tell.[12:5] About such a man I will boast, but about myself I will not boast except as regards my weaknesses.[12:6] Yet if I choose to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will be speaking no more than the truth. But I refrain, in case anyone should credit me with more than he can see in me or hear from me, and because of the marvellous character of the revelations.[12:7] It was for this reason, and to prevent my thinking too highly of myself, that a thorn was sent to pierce my flesh – an instrument of Satan to discipline me – so that I should not think too highly of myself.[12:8] About this I three times entreated the Lord, praying that it might leave me.[12:9] But his reply has been –  “My help is enough for you; for my strength attains its perfection in the midst of weakness.” 

Most gladly, then, will I boast all the more of my weaknesses, so that the strength of the Christ may overshadow me.[12:10] That is why I delight in weakness, ill treatment, hardship, persecution, and difficulties, when borne for Christ. For, when I am weak, then it is that I am strong!

##### Conclusion #####

[12:11] I have been ‘playing the fool!’ It is you who drove me to it. For it is you who ought to have been commending me! Although I am nobody, in no respect did I prove inferior to the most eminent apostles.[12:12] The marks of the true apostle were exhibited among you in constant endurance, as well as by signs, by marvels, and by miracles.[12:13] In what respect, I ask, were you treated worse than the other churches, unless it was that, for my part, I refused to become a burden to you? Forgive me the wrong I did to you!

[12:14] Remember, this is the third time that I have made every preparation to come to see you, and I will refuse to be a burden to you; I want, not your money, but you. It is not the duty of children to put by for their parents, but of parents to put by for their children.[12:15] For my part, I will most gladly spend, and be spent, for your welfare. Can it be that the more intensely I love you the less I am to be loved?[12:16] You will admit that I was not a burden to you but you say that I was ‘crafty’ and caught you ‘by a trick’![12:17] Do you assert that I took advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you?[12:18] I urged Titus to go, and I sent another follower with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn’t we live in the same Spirit, and tread in the same footsteps?

[12:19] Have you all this time been fancying that it is to you that we are making our defence? No, it is in the sight of God, and in union with Christ, that we are speaking. And all this, dear friends, is to build up your characters;[12:20] for I am afraid that perhaps, when I come, I may find that you are not what I want you to be, and, on the other hand, that you may find that I am what you do not want me to be. I am afraid that I may find quarrelling, jealousy, ill feeling, rivalry, slandering, backbiting, self-assertion, and disorder.[12:21] I am afraid that, on my next visit, my God may humble me in regard to you, and that I may have to mourn over many who have long been sinning, and have not repented of the impurity, immorality, and sensuality, in which they have indulged.

 [2 Corinthians 13] 

[13:1] For the third time I am coming to see you. By the word of two or three witnesses each statement will be established.[13:2] I have said it, and I say it again before I come, just as if I were with you on my second visit, though for the moment absent, I say to those who have been long sinning, as well as to all others – that if I come again, I will spare no one.[13:3] And that will be the proof, which you are looking for, that the Christ speaks through me. There is no weakness in his dealings with you. No, he shows his power among you.[13:4] For though his crucifixion was due to weakness, his life is due to the power of God. And we, also, are weak in his weakness, but with him we will live for you through the power of God.[13:5] Put yourselves to the proof, to see whether you are holding to the faith. Test yourselves. Surely you recognise this fact about yourselves – that Jesus Christ is in you! Unless indeed you cannot stand the test![13:6] But I hope that you will recognise that we can stand the test.[13:7] We pray God that you may do nothing wrong, not that we may be seen to stand the test, but that you may do what is right, even though we may seem not to stand the test.[13:8] We have no power at all against the truth, but we have power in the service of the truth.[13:9] We are glad when we are weak, if you are strong. And what we pray for is that you may become perfect.[13:10] This is my reason for writing as I am now doing, while I am away from you, so that, when I am with you, I may not act harshly in the exercise of the authority which the Lord gave me – and gave me for building up and not for pulling down.

[13:11] And now, friends, goodbye. Aim at perfection; take courage; agree together; live in peace. And then God, the source of all love and peace, will be with you.[13:12] Greet one another with a sacred kiss.[13:13] All Christ’s people here send you their greetings.

[13:14] May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion with the Holy Spirit, be with you all.
