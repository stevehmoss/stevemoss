						<h1>An Experimental Paul</h1>
			What follows is purely an experiment to see what Paul would look like if the letters were taken out of the context of the Jewish religion. I am not an academic and I'm just playing around with an idea. I am well aware of how silly this idea will seem to many, but I present it here as is, with only a few brief notes to explain my thinking:
				<br>
				<br>
				Nothing at all is known about First Century Christianity from sources outside the Christian texts themselves. Most Biblical scholars agree that the earliest Christian writings are the letters that Paul wrote to the communities he established in several cities located in the Eastern half of the Roman Empire during the middle decades of the First Century of the Common Era. The oldest fragments of these letters that exist today date to the<a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_manuscript#Earliest_extant_manuscripts">late second century,</a> over a hundred years after they are thought to have been actually written by Paul. They are undoubtedly copies of copies of copies, and must contain many alterations both by mistake and by deliberate modification.
				<br>
				<br>
				During that intervening century the four canonical Gospels were written. The story of Jesus as a living man was written for the first time in Mark, probably late First Century, and the story was placed within the context of the Jewish religion and the geographical setting of Jerusalem and surrounding countryside. I think that the letters of Paul were modified during this time to fit within the broader Jewish cultural framework, even though Paul's letters seem to be really saying that the spirituality he has discovered is purely between oneself and God. It is the Christ within us that has a relationship with God like that which the "son" has with the "father" - no religion required. The God found in Paul is not a creator or an enforcer, but a benign universal Power concerned only with the propagation of Love.
				<br>
				<br>
				Paul's letters are to the Greek-speaking people of the Roman world. The places he wrote to are a long way from Judea, the closest being Galatia in what is now Turkey, the rest all being in Greece or Italy. Why is he bothering to discuss Jewish Law with them? He is constantly referring to his ministry being directed to the Gentiles, who surely would neither know about or be intersted in the Jewish religion. I can't prove that the Jewish stuff was added later, so I won't even attempt to do so. What I'm really interested in is trying to get a sense of how things were in those first few decades. There was an exciting new kind of spirituality beginning, one in which everyone was equal both within the organisational structure of the communities and in the eyes of God. It was a spiritual community with the only governing authority being the power of Love. I think it was inevitable that something so sweet and simple would be overrun by an influx of people getting on the band-wagon and securing positions of power. In a funny way we owe it to these people that we still have access to Paul's original writings: It was by fitting Christianity into the time-line of the older, established Jewish religion that Christianity was made solid, powerful and robust enough to last for thousands of years. Paul's gentle ideas of love and humility would have fallen into dust long ago if they hadn't been taken over by people wanting to serve themselves...
				<br>
				<br>
				So what I have done here is I've removed all of the discussion about Jewish Law. Most of this is in the letter to the Romans. That letter is by far the longest, but without the Jewish stuff its length becomes similar to the others, which seems more likely to me. I have also removed phrases which sound like they are saying Jesus was human, because I don't think Paul ever thought that.
				<br>
				<br>
				I've used the "Scholars Version" of Paul, found in <a href="https://www.westarinstitute.org/projects/the-jesus-seminar/jesus-seminar-on-paul/">Authentic Letters of Paul.</a>for the internal structure and chronological ordering of the letters. This is a recent translation based on modern schoarship which removes many passages not thought to be by the same author. For the text I have used the <a href="https://openenglishbible.org/">Open English Bible. </a>I have only subtracted, I haven't added anything. I have made a few minor changes to their language just to help the flow. I've abandoned the traditional numbering of chapters and verses, as these did not occur in any early manuscripts.
				<br>
				<br>It is my own personal opinion that what follows might be closer to what Paul actually wrote, however I stress again that it is just an experiment to see what Paul might look like if the letters were taken out of the context of the Jewish Religion.

<h1>Paul's Letter to the Thessalonians </h1>
To the Thessalonian church in union with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, from Paul, Silas, and Timothy. May God bless you and give you peace. We always mention you in our prayers and thank God for you all, recalling continually before our God and Father the efforts that have resulted from your faith, the toil prompted by your love, and the patient endurance sustained by your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
<br>
<br>
Friends, whom God loves, we know that he has chosen you because the good news that we brought came home to you, not merely as so many words, but with a power and a fulness of conviction due to the Holy Spirit. For you know the life that we lived among you for your good. You yourselves began to follow our example and, in spite of much suffering, you welcomed the message with a joy inspired by the Holy Spirit. Thus you became a pattern to all who believed in Christ throughout Macedonia and Greece, for it was from you that the Lord’s message resounded throughout Macedonia and Greece and, more than that, your faith in God has become known far and wide so that there is no need for us to say another word. Indeed, in speaking about us, the people themselves tell of the reception you gave us, and how, turning to God from your idols, you became servants of the true and living God and are now awaiting the return from heaven of his Son Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath.
<br>
<br>
Yes, friends, you yourselves know that your reception of us was not without result, for although we had experienced suffering and ill treatment, as you know, at Philippi, we had the courage, by the help of our God, to tell you God’s good news in spite of great opposition. Our appeal to you was not based on a delusion, nor was it made from unworthy motives, or with any intention of misleading you. But, having been found worthy by God to be entrusted with the good news, therefore we tell it; with a view to please, not people, but Godwho already knows our intentions. Never at any time, as you know, did we use the language of flattery, or make false professions in order to hide selfish aims. God will bear witness to that. Nor did we seek to win honour from people, whether from you or from others, although, as messengers of Christ we might have asserted our authority. But we lived among you with the simplicity of a child; we were like a woman nursing her own children. In our strong affection for you, that seemed to us the best way of sharing with you, not only God’s good news, but our lives as well – so dear had you become to us. You will not have forgotten, friends, our labour and toil. Night and day we used to work at our trades, so as not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you God’s good news. You will bear witness, and God also, that our relations with you who believed in Christ were pure, and upright, and beyond reproach. Indeed, you know that, like a father with his own children, we used to encourage and comfort every one of you, and solemnly plead with you so that you should make your daily lives worthy of God who is calling you into the glory of his kingdom.
<br>
<br>
This, too, is a reason why we, on our part, are continually thanking God – because, in receiving the teaching that you had from us, you accepted it, not as the teaching of humans, but as what it really is – the teaching of God, which is even now doing its work within you who believe in Christ.[2:14] For you, friends, began to follow the example of the communities in Judea which are in union with Christ; you, in your turn, suffering at the hands of your fellow citizens, in the same way as those communities did at the hands of their people. 
<br>
<br>
As for ourselves, friends, our having been bereaved of you even for a short time – though in body only, and not in spirit – made us all the more eager to see your faces again; and the longing to do so was strong on us. That was why we made up our minds to go and see you – at least I, Paul, did, more than once – but our plans were frustrated. Who will be our pride and joy and crowning glory when we meet manifest the Christ, if not you? You are our pride and our delight!
<br>
<br>
 And so, as we could bear it no longer, we made up our minds to remain behind alone at Athens, and sent Timothy, our dear friend and God’s minister of the good news of the Christ, to strengthen you, and to encourage you in your faith so that none of you should be shaken by the troubles through which you are passing. You yourselves know that we are destined to meet with such things. For, even while we were with you, we warned you beforehand that we were certain to encounter trouble. And so it proved, as you know. Therefore, since I could no longer endure the uncertainty, I sent to make inquiries about your faith, fearing that our toil might prove to have been in vain. But, when Timothy recently returned to us from you with good news of your faith and love, and told us how kindly you think of us – always longing, he said, to see us, just as we are longing to see you. On hearing this, we felt encouraged about you, friends, in the midst of all our difficulties and troubles, by your faith. For it is new life to us to know that you are holding fast to the Lord. How can we thank God enough for all the happiness that you are giving us in the sight of our God? Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face, and make good any deficiency in your faith. May our God and Father himself make the way plain for us to come to you and for you, may the Lord fill you to overflowing with love for one another and for everyone, just as we are filled with love for you and so make your hearts strong, and your lives pure beyond reproach, in the sight of our God and Father.
<br>
<br>
Finally, friends, we beg and urge you in the name of Christ to carry out more fully than ever – as indeed you are already doing – all that you have heard from us as to what your daily life must be, if it is to please God. For you have not forgotten the directions that we gave you on the authority of Christ. 
<br>
<br>
For this is God’s purpose that you should be pure, abstaining from all immorality. Each of you learning to gain control over your own body, in a way that is holy and honourable, and not for the mere gratification of your passions, like the Gentiles who know nothing of God. Also never overreaching or taking advantage of their fellow follower of the Christ in such matters. Christ will see that justice is done in all such matters. God’s call to us does not permit of an impure life, but demands virtue. Therefore the person who disregards this warning disregards, not people, but God breathes the spirit of goodness into you.
<br>
<br>
As to love for each other there is no need to write to you, for you have yourselves been taught by God to love one another and indeed you do act in this spirit towards all his people throughout Macedonia. Yet, friends, we beg you to do even more. Make it your ambition to live quietly, and to attend to your own business, and to work with your hands, as we directed you, so that your conduct may win respect from those outside the church, and that you may not want for anything.
<br>
<br>We beg you, friends, to value those who toil among you, and are your leaders in Christ’s service, and give you counsel. Hold them in the very greatest esteem and affection for the sake of their work. Live at peace with one another. We entreat you also, friends, to warn the disorderly, comfort the faint-hearted, give a helping hand to the weak, and be patient with everyone. Take care that none of you ever pays back wrong for wrong, but always follow the kindest course with one another and with everyone. Always be joyful; never cease to pray; under all circumstances give thanks to God. For this is his will for you as made known in Christ. Do not quench the Spirit. Do not make light of preaching. Bring everything to the test; cling to what is good; shun every form of evil. May God himself, the giver of peace, fill you with goodness.
